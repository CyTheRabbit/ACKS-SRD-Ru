  <h1 id="chapter-2-heroes">Chapter 2: Heroes</h1>
  <p><i>Hers was a hero, destin'd to command <br>
  A martial race, and rule the Latian land, <br>
  Who should his ancient line from Teucer draw, <br>
  And on the conquer'd world impose the law.</i><br>
  – The Aeneid, Book IV (Virgil)</p>
  <h2 id="ability-scores">Ability Scores</h2>
  <p>By default, the Adventurer Conqueror King System assumes that adventurers are no more or less gifted than the average person. If they become great, it is because of their achievements in play, not because of special advantages during character generation. As a result, the ability scores for ACKS adventurers are generated by rolling 3d6 in order. If the optional Generating Multiple Characters rule is in effect, where players roll up five characters and select the best to play with, then adventurers are perhaps among the top 20% most talented people, but still drawn from the common stock. In some heroic campaign settings, however, the adventurers are men and women of extraordinary gifts – protagonists such as Achilles, Aeneas, Aragorn, Beowulf, Conan, Elric, and Red Sonja are gifted with might, confidence, and power far beyond the norm.</p>
  <p>To account for this, the Heroic Fantasy Handbook offers the following optional methods for rolling up characters with better ability scores.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Heroic: Roll 4d6 for each ability score in order. Drop the lowest die, tally the remaining dice, and record that result.</li>
  <li>Legendary: Roll 5d6 for each ability score in order. Drop the lowest 2 dice, tally the remaining dice, and record that result.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Heroic characters will have ability scores in approximately the same range as the top fifth of normal characters (11-14, averaging 12.24). Legendary characters will have ability scores in approximately the same range as the top fifth of heroic characters (12-16, averaging 13.43). If desired the Judge can have players roll up five characters when using either method.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>EXAMPLE: Newton is creating an adventurer for use in a heroic campaign. The Judge has decided to use the optional “Legendary Ability Scores” and “Generating Multiple Characters” rules. Newton therefore will generate five characters; for each character, he will generate six ability scores, rolling 5d6 for each in order and dropping the lowest 2 dice. This combination of optional rules creates very powerful characters! Newton’s results are, in order for STR, INT, WIS, DEX, CON, and CHA: #1 STR 13, INT 17, WIS 11, DEX 15, CON 13, CHA 13;  #2 STR 13, INT 11, WIS 15, DEX 16, CON 11, CHA 15; #3 STR 6, INT 14, WIS 16, DEX 12, CON 12, CHA 13; #4  STR 14, INT 9, WIS 16, DEX 14, CON 17, CHA 14; #5 STR 15, INT 15, WIS 16, DEX 13, CON 14, CHA 17. He decides to select character #5. He selects Elven Spellsinger as his character class, reducing STR to 13 to increase CHA to 18. His final character has STR 13, INT 15, WIS 16, DEX 13, CON 14, CHA 18.</p>

  <h3 id="wisdom-modifier">Wisdom Modifier</h3>
  <p>In heroic fantasy campaigns, a character’s WIS modifier should be applied to all saving throws, not just saving throws versus magic.</p>
  <h2 id="hit-points">Hit Points</h2>
  <p>Hit points are a measure of a character’s ability to survive in combat. Hit points are not a direct representation of the character’s capacity to receive physical injury. A character with 40 hp cannot survive eight sword stabs to the stomach! Rather, they represent a holistic combination of fighting skill, stamina, luck, and the favor of the gods, all of which contribute to helping the character roll with blows and survive attacks that would have killed a lesser combatant. Therefore, the amount of damage a weapon deals must be understood relative to the hit points of the character struck. It is the percentage of hit points lost, not the raw number lost, that indicates how physically wounded a character or monster is.</p>
  <p>However, in virtually every retro-clone (including ACKS), the elegant abstraction of hit points is marred by an asymmetry between damage and healing. Consider two characters, a normal man with 5 hp and an epic hero with 40 hp. When the normal man is dealt 4 points of damage by a sword, this is a grievous blow (80% of his hit points); when the epic hero is dealt the same 4 points of damage, this is merely a flesh wound (10% of his hp). This is exactly as it should be. Yet when the epic hero is treated with cure light wounds, he recovers 1d6+1 points of damage – enough to repair a light wound, as the spell suggests; while when the normal man is treated with cure light wounds, he is likely to recover from what we just said was a grievous blow that brought him near death. To fix this asymmetry, The Heroic Fantasy Handbook offers rules for proportional healing.</p>
  <h3 id="healing">Healing</h3>
  <p>All beings recover hit points through rest. For each full day of complete rest in reasonably sanitary conditions, a creature will recover its base healing rate (BHR). If its rest is interrupted, the creature will not heal that day. A creature’s base healing rate is based on its maximum hit points, as shown on the Base Healing Rate table. A character’s BHR should be recorded on its character sheet, and updated each time the character gains additional hit points.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>EXAMPLE: Athelstan has 12 hp. His base healing rate is 1d4 hp per day. With a full day of complete rest in sanitary conditions, Athelstan will recover between 1 and 4 hp. If his rest is interrupted, he will not heal.</p>

  <p>Characters with the Healing proficiency can shorten their patient’s recovery time. A patient under treatment of Healing recovers twice his base healing rate in hp each day of rest.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>EXAMPLE: If Athelstan were the patient of a character with Healing proficiency, he would recover twice his base healing rate of 1d4 hp per day of rest, i.e. 2d4 hp per day of rest.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Healing also occurs through magic, such as potions or spells. This kind of healing is instantaneous and will typically be equal to one or more days of rest, as shown on the Magical Healing table. Magical healing and natural healing can be combined.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>EXAMPLE: Athelstan (with 12 hp and a base healing rate of 1d4 hp) has sustained 9 points of damage, leaving him with 3 hp. A cleric treats him with comfrey. Comfrey heals its target by half as much as if he had rested for one day, rounded up. Athelstan’s base healing rate is 1d4 hp per day, so he will heal 1d4/2 hp. The result of the roll is a 3, so Athelstan is healed (3 / 2) 1.5 hp, rounded up to 2 hp. The cleric then casts cure moderate wounds on Athelstan. Cure moderate wounds heals its target as if he had rested for two days, so Athelstan will heal 2d4 hp. The result of the roll is a 5, so Athelstan is healed 5 points. He now has 10 hp of his maximum of 12.</p>

  <li>These effects occur instead of the spell or magic item’s effect under the ACKS core rules.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Heroic Breakfast Memorial Rule (Optional):</b> Once per day a character can recover his base healing rate in hp by consuming a meal accompanied by alcohol, coffee, or tea. This recovery is in addition to any hit points gained from complete rest. Halfling characters may consume a second breakfast for an additional recovery of hp.</p>
  <h3 id="mortal-wounds">Mortal Wounds</h3>
  <p>When a creature’s hit points drop to 0 or fewer, the creature is unconscious and possibly dead. The creature’s condition will not be determined until an ally treats its wounds. When this occurs, the unconscious creature must roll 1d20+1d6 on the Mortal Wounds table and apply any appropriate modifiers listed. The modified 1d20 roll determines the unconscious creature’s condition while the modified 1d6 roll determines whether any permanent wounds are suffered. Characters not treated within 24 hours of being unconscious must roll, with no bonus for treatment and at the full -10 penalty for being treated 1 day later.</p>
  <p><b>Heroic Survival:</b> In heroic fantasy campaigns, heroes are considerably more likely to survive mortal wounds than ordinary men. Adventurers with d6 HD add +2 to their 1d20 roll on the Mortal Wounds table. Adventurers with d8 HD add +4, adventurers with d10 HD add +6, and adventurers with d12 HD add +8.</p>
  <p>Some results on the Mortal Wounds table will indicate that a character needs a period of bed rest to recover. During this time, the character cannot recover to more than 1 hp and cannot take any action other than speaking and moving at half speed. The period of bed rest can be shortened with magical healing – simply count the days of rest from the magical healing towards the recovery period. However, a character cannot benefit from more than one type of magical healing per day when recovering from mortal wounds.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>EXAMPLE: A fight goes badly, and Athelstan suffers grievous wounds; he will require 14 days of bed rest to recover. The party hires the patriarch of the local temple to cast cure critical wounds on Athelstan. This heals Athelstan as if he had rested for 5 days. Athelstan now requires (14-5) 9 days of bed rest to recover.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If a character suffers permanent wounds, powerful healing magic such as a restore life and limb spell, regeneration spell, or ring of regeneration can eliminate any penalties caused. If applied swiftly, other types of healing can also eliminate the penalties from permanent wounds. If healing (magic or proficiency) restores the character to 1 hit point within 1 turn (10 minutes) of receiving the permanent wound, then the penalties from the permanent wound will be eliminated once the character completes the required bed rest. The permanent wound’s effects will still be present during the recovery period, however.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>EXAMPLE: During a defense of the town from orc raiders, Athelstan is reduced to -9 hp and must roll on the Mortal Wounds table. The roll goes badly – grievous wounds resulting in one of his arms being crushed. Fortunately, the patriarch of the local temple is nearby, and able to cast cure critical wounds on Athelstan just a few rounds after he is injured. Since Athelstan’s base healing rate is 1d4 hp, cure critical wounds heals him of 5d4 hp. The roll is a 10, enough to raise him to 1 hp. When Athelstan finishes his period of bed rest (2 weeks), he will regain use of his arm.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If a character dies, he can be revived with restore life and limb, reincarnation, or other magical effect that restores the dead to life. Characters treated with restore life and limb often need extensive periods of time to recover, and may suffer strange side effects. The character must roll 1d20+1d6 on the Tampering with Mortality table and apply any appropriate modifiers listed. The resulting side effects are permanent and can only be removed with a wish spell. The recovery period, if any, from tampering with mortality can be shorted with magical healing as described above. Note that magic which can restore the dead to life is very rare in campaigns using the Heroic Fantasy Handbook.</p>
  <p><b>Khal Drogo Memorial Rule (Optional):</b> In worlds where wounds can fester and grow foul there is no assurance that an injured hero will recover. Each day that a character rests while recovering from incapacitation, he must make a saving throw versus Death. Apply the character’s CON modifier to the saving throw. If the save succeeds, the day counts towards his period of bed rest. If the save fails, the character’s condition does not improve. If the save fails by 5 or more, or with a natural 1, the character’s condition worsens and the period of bed rest required advances by one day.  If the remaining period of bed rest required ever reaches more than 45 days, the character dies of sepsis, shock, or system failure. This optional rule does not apply to magical healing, but if you’re using this rule, you’re probably not allowing that anyway!</p>
  <h3 id="temporary-hit-points">Temporary Hit Points</h3>
  <p>Temporary hit points represent temporary blessings or inspiration during which character’s fighting skill, stamina, luck, and the favor of the gods is improved. Temporary hit points are not actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage.  Characters with temporary hit points who take damage lose the temporary hit points first, with any leftover damage carrying over to their normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage. A character can be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points. Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added together. If a character has 0 or fewer hit points, receiving temporary hit points does not count as healing.</p>
  <h2 id="new-and-modified-character-classes">New and Modified Character Classes</h2>
  <p>In order to better represent the archetypes that appear in heroic fantasy, the Heroic Fantasy Handbook introduces several new campaign and racial classes. The core, campaign, and racial character classes presented in the Adventurer Conqueror King System and the Player’s Companion can also be used in Heroic Fantasy Handbook campaigns, although we recommend that some classes be modified or replaced, as noted below. To avoid forcing players to flip between multiple books, we have included complete descriptions of class powers such as turn undead even if they have already appeared elsewhere.</p>
  <h3 id="new-character-classes">New Character Classes</h3>
  <p>The new classes in this book include the beastmaster, berserker,  chosen, ecclesiastic, elven spellsinger, freebooter, halfling bounder, halfling burglar, loremaster, Nobiran champion, Nobiran wizard, occultist, runemaker, Thrassian deathchanter, warmistress, Zaharan darklord, and Zaharan sorcerer. In addition, a revised magic-free version of the venturer (originally appearing in the Player’s Companion) is presented.</p>
  <h3 id="beastmaster">Beastmaster</h3>
  <p><i>His straight and perfect figure, muscled as the best of the ancient Roman gladiators must have been muscled, and yet with the soft and sinuous curves of a Greek god, told at a glance the wondrous combination of enormous strength with suppleness and speed. A personification, was Tarzan of the Apes, of the primitive man, the hunter, the warrior. With the noble poise of his handsome head upon those broad shoulders, and the fire of life and intelligence in those fine, clear eyes, he might readily have typified some demigod of a wild and warlike bygone people of his ancient forest.</i> – Tarzan of the Apes (E.R. Burroughs)</p>

  <p>Some kings and heroes, dreadful in aspect and demeanor, are whispered to have been raised by beasts, suckled by wolves, adopted by the wild. Such tales are rarely true. Most feral children live short and brutish lives, dying young without ever seeing another of their own kind; even if found, they have often regressed into a state of savagery from which their natural humanity cannot free them. But from time to time, a child, abandoned or lost to civilization and adopted by beasts, may be endowed with the strength and character to transcend both man and beast and become something greater. Such children, if they survive, become beastmasters – lords of the wild, combining the ferocity and toughness of a predator with the cunning and courage of a hero.</p>
  <p>Beastmasters fight with the instincts and aggression of natural predators. At first level, beastmasters hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their damage from attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level.  Beastmasters care nothing for civilized concepts such as chivalric combat, preferring to attack with surprise whenever possible. They may backstab as thieves of their class level.</p>
  <p>However, beastmasters lack formal training in arms and armor, and can wield only primitive weapons of the sort they could have fashioned in the wild: spears, hand axes, daggers, bolas, darts, nets, slings, saps, and staves. They may fight wielding a weapon two-handed, and wielding a weapon in each had, but may not use shields nor wear armor.  They may use only magic items usable by fighters.</p>
  <p>Due to their savage upbringing, beastmasters have animal reflexes, gaining +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to surprise rolls. They are constantly alert to danger, and can hear noises as a thief of their class level. From the unspeakable hardships they have endured, beastmasters gain savage resilience. When a beastmaster is required to consult the Mortal Wounds table, the player may roll twice and choose the preferred result to apply.  Beastmasters also subtract their class level from the number of days of bed rest required to recover.</p>
  <p>At a young age, beastmasters learn to clamber up trees, cliffs, and other vertical services with the agility of a monkey. As a result, all beastmasters can climb as a thief of their class level. They also can perform feats of acrobatics such as swinging on vines or leaping over foes. In lieu of moving during a round, a beastmaster may attempt a proficiency throw of 20+ to tumble behind an opponent in melee. The proficiency throw required for the tumble is reduced by 1 per level of experience the character possesses. If successful, the beastmaster is now behind his opponent. The opponent loses the benefit of his shield, if any, and the beastmaster can backstab his opponent (gaining +4 to his attack throw and bonus damage based on his level). Beastmasters also gain a +2 bonus to saving throws where agility would help avoid the situation, such as tilting floors and pit traps.</p>
  <p>Like other predators of the night, beastmasters are naturally stealthy, and opponents suffer a -1 penalty to surprise rolls when encountering them. Outdoors, beastmasters are difficult to spot, having the ability to seemingly disappear into woods and underbrush with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. In dungeons, a beastmaster who is motionless and quiet in cover can escape detection with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20.</p>
  <p>As natives of the wild, beastmasters bring significant advantages to parties on wilderness adventures. Any time the beastmaster’s party is in country familiar to the beastmaster, they get a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to avoid getting lost. In any terrain except clear and grassland terrain, the beastmaster’s party receives a +5 bonus to proficiency throws to evade wilderness encounters. A party guided by a beastmaster can evade wilderness encounters even when surprised on a proficiency throw of 19+.</p>
  <p>Once per day, a beastmaster may shout a bestial cry that can be heard up to 750’ away.  Hostile ordinary animals hearing the cry must immediately make a successful morale roll or run away from the beastmaster. Other ordinary animals hearing the beastmaster’s cry may come to his assistance. If the animal is friendly to the beastmaster (e.g. if it is a henchman, a trained animal, or resident within 5 miles of his encampment) it will automatically run or fly to his assistance as quickly as possible. Otherwise, the Judge should make a reaction roll for each animal, with a Friendly result indicating the creature comes to the beastmaster’s assistance.</p>
  <p>Having been raised by and with animals, all beastmasters are friends of birds and beasts. They understand the subtle body language and moods of normal animals (though the animals may not understand the character), which grants beastmasters a +2 to all reaction rolls when encountering normal animals and allows them to take animals as henchmen. They also can identify flora and fauna with a proficiency throw of 11+.</p>
  <p>Conversely, all beastmasters are discomfited by civilization. The sights, smells, and ways of cities are foreign and offensive to them. A beastmaster suffers a penalty to reaction rolls when in urban settlements equal to 7 minus the settlement’s market value.</p>
  <p>When purchasing starting equipment, a beastmaster may only select primitive weapons, animal parts (from Lairs &amp; Encounters) blankets, healing herbs, ropes, poles, rations, sacks, stakes, tents, torches, and trained animals. However, any trained animals that the beastmaster begins play with may be immediately recruited as henchmen if desired. Any unspent coin is lost.</p>
  <p>When a beastmaster reaches 5th level (Mighty Warrior), his animal magnetism begins to inspire the men and beasts that follow him. Any henchmen of the beastmaster, and any guard or hunting animals handled by the beastmaster, gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the beastmaster’s Charisma or proficiencies.</p>
  <p>At 9th level (Lord of the Wild), a beastmaster can establish an encampment in a wilderness hex. A beastmaster’s encampment is often centered on a wooden cabin or house perched in the highest branches of a great tree. A beastmaster does not attract followers when he establishes an encampment, but he does gain the fellowship of animals: all ordinary animals within 5 miles of it become kind and helpful (as per an elven fastness).</p>

  <p>Berserkers are barbarian warriors blessed by pagan gods with the power to enter a trance-like battle rage known as the berserkergang. While enraged, a berserker fights with bear-like ferocity and can shrug off blows that would fell normal men. Berserkers are feared even by their allies, for in the grip of the berserkergang, a man may cut down his dearest friend as easily as his bitterest foe. Some berserkers find their gift brings ruin on themselves, ending up as outlaws and kin-slayers without family or friend; but most are recruited into warrior-cults of like-minded brothers, where they learn to master their fury. In time, berserkers may become famous raiders, housecarls, or even great chieftains. In the Auran Empire, berserkers might be reavers from the bleak wastes of northern Jutland, fierce lancers from Skysostan, or savage tribesmen from the Ivory Kingdom jungles of Keita, Munde, and Kushtu.</p>
  <p>At first level, berserkers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. Berserkers increase their base damage roll from successful melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. Although sometimes skilled with missile and especially thrown weapons, a berserker revels in close combat, fighting his enemies eye to eye, not at a distance.
  Berserkers enter battle without care for life and limb, and may only wear leather or lighter armor. Like their barbarian kinsmen, they are limited to fighting with the traditional weapons and styles of their tribe. When a berserker is created, select a region of origin for the character from the Regional Origin table below and note down the permitted weapons and fighting styles. The Judge may create other regions of origin within his own campaign setting where necessary. (Note that berserkers do not share their barbarian kinsmen’s natural proficiency. Some berserkers may choose to use a class proficiency to match their kinsmen, while other berserkers choose to stand apart from their kinsmen and learn different skills.) Berserkers may only use magic items usable by fighters.</p>

  <p>Like the hardy barbarians from which they are drawn, berserkers resist injury with savage resilience. When a berserker is required to consult the Mortal Wounds table, the player may roll twice and choose the preferred result to apply. Berserkers subtract their class level from the number of days of bed rest required to recover.</p>
  <p>What sets the berserker apart from his barbarian kin is his ability to enter berserkergang, the killing rage of mayhem and madness. A berserker’s rage encompasses both lesser and greater states. A berserker may enter a lesser berserkergang at will. Entering a lesser berserkergang does not count as an action, so the berserker may freely go berserker, move, and attack on the same round. While in a lesser berserkergang, a berserker gains a +2 bonus to attack throws and becomes immune to fear. However, the berserker suffers a -2 penalty to AC and cannot retreat from combat. Once it has begun, a lesser berserkergang cannot be ended until combat ends.</p>
  <p>While some ferocious fighters and brutal barbarians also learn to enter the lesser berserkergang (by selecting the Berserkergang proficiency) the greater berserkergang is unique to the berserker class. A berserker may enter the greater  berserkergang only once per day. (A berserker who selects ranks of the Berserkergang proficiency increases the number of times per day he can enter greater berserkergang by one per rank.) Entering a greater berserkergang requires 1 full round (10 seconds), during which time the berserker works himself into a frenzy, biting on his shield, foaming at the mouth, and howling like a wild animal. While in a greater berserkergang, the berserker gains a +2 bonus to attack throws and damage rolls and becomes immune to fear. Additionally the berserker decreases the damage from any non-magical attacks by 1 point per die. (Damage can be reduced to 0, but not less than 0, on each die. Attacks from monsters of 5 HD or more are considered magical attacks due to the monster’s ferocity.) This protection increases to 2 points per die at 7th level and 3 points per die at 13th level.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>EXAMPLE: Beorn is a 7th level berserker. He is struck by an ogre, dealing 2d6 damage. The damage roll is a 3 and a 5, but Beorn reduces the damage from non-magical attacks by 2 points per die, so he takes 1 and 3. Beorn therefore only takes 4 damage from the ogre. The damage reduction is applied per die.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>However, a berserker in a state of greater berserkergang cannot retreat from combat, and has trouble distinguishing friend from foe. If a berserker in a greater berserkergang rolls a natural 1 on an attack throw, he automatically hits a nearby ally within 5’ in lieu of his preferred target. Once begun, a greater berserkergang cannot be ended until combat ends. When the greater berserkergang ends, the berserker is immediately exhausted. While exhausted, the berserker cannot charge or run, and suffers a -1 penalty on attack and proficiency throws. A berserker can recover from exhaustion by resting for 1 turn (10 minutes).</p>
  <p>Outsiders may view a berserker’s rage as a curse or madness, but berserkers know that their powers are actually gifts granted by the pagan gods. The berserker’s relationship to the gods is embodied in a totem animal such as bear totem, boar totem, or wolf totem.  At 1st level (Hunter), a berserker discovers the nature of his totem and gains its totem benefit, a bonus proficiency related to the totem. The berserker’s totem should be appropriate to the character’s ability scores and tribal traditions. At a minimum, the berserker must possess an ability score of at least 9 in his totem’s key ability. Over time, the berserker will come to resemble his totem animal. For instance, a bear berserker might become burly and hirsute, a wolf berserker might become yellow-eyed, lean, and toothy, and a hyena berserker may develop a hunchback and braying laugh. Berserkers often organize themselves into warrior-cults dedicated to their particular totem animal.</p>
  <p>The Totem Animals table, below, lists the key abilities and totem benefits of several sample totems. The Judge may create additional totems at his discretion. Berserkers from Jutland traditionally select either bear, boar, or wolf; from Skysostan, either eagle, hyena, or tiger; and from the Ivory Kingdoms, bull, lion, or panther.</p>
  <p>Starting at 5th level (reaver), a berserker gains the ability to shapechange into his totem animal. The berserker remains in his new shape until he changes back. A 5th level berserker can initially shapechange once per day. For example, if he begins the day in human form, he can shapechange into his totem animal form, but he then has to remain in totem animal form until the following day, when he can change back to his human shape. With each level of experience gained, the berserker can change shape one additional time per day. When in totem animal form, the berserker has the movement, armor class, attacks, damage, and powers listed on the Totem Animals table, below. He retains his normal Hit Dice, hit points, attack throws, and saving throws. If the berserker is of greater Hit Dice than his animal type, he will appear as a bigger, stronger version of the animal, to a maximum of twice normal size. For example, a 10th level berserker in lion shape would appear as a huge predator, twice the mass of a normal lion. A larger-than normal totem animal form increases each damage die by +1. Apart from size, the berserker is indistinguishable from a normal animal. The totem animal shape does not detect as magical, is not detected by spells that reveal illusions, and cannot be dispelled. Changing shape can be performed during combat in lieu of making an attack. Alternatively, a berserker may expend a use of shapechange to enter into a greater berserkergang, tapping into his animal spirit to unleash his inner savagery.</p>
  <p>Note that while a berserker’s relationship to his totem animal resembles that of a shaman’s, berserkers do not acquire an actual animal companion – they merely take on some of the characteristics of their totem.</p>

  <p>ǂ Berserker retains his normal HD and hp; but if berserker’s HD exceed totem animal form’s HD, increase damage die by +1</p>
  <p>At 5th level a berserker’s animal magnetism also begins to inspire those who follow him. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the berserker gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the berserker’s Charisma or proficiencies.</p>
  <p>Upon reaching 9th level (Warchief), a berserker can build or claim a chieftain’s hall. When the berserker establishes his hall, 1d4+1x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 berserkers of 1st-3rd level will serve him. The berserkers will be of the same region and totem animal as their warchief. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. Chieftains’ halls are otherwise identical to fighters’ castles, as detailed in the Campaign chapter of the ACKS Rulebook.</p>
  <p>At 9th level a  berserker also gains the ability to spiritwalk. After 1 turn (10 minutes) of chanting, the berserker enters a deep trance during which his spirit walks free of his body. Once a spiritwalk begins, it continues until the berserker’s spirit returns to his body, to a maximum duration of 1 hour per level. A spiritwalking berserker’s spirit can assume either human or totem animal shape as desired. In either shape, the berserker can see and hear normally, move around at his shape’s normal movement rate, and pass through solid objects without difficulty. However, the spiritwalking berserker cannot see into, hear sounds from, or move through an area warded by an anti-magic shell or protection from evil spell or similar effect. The spiritwalking berserker is incorporeal and invisible, but can be detected with detect invisible or true seeing, harmed by spells and magic weapons if detected, and forced to return to his body with dispel evil. If the berserker’s body is destroyed, the character dies at the end of the spiritwalk. If the berserker’s spirit is destroyed, his body falls into a catatonic slumber that can only be lifted with restore life and limb, resurrection, or wish. Spiritwalking is so taxing that it can be performed but once per week.</p>

  <p><em>“My friend, it is in my heart that you were chosen by the Creator. That is our hope. Lord Foul taught Drool to do the summoning because he desired white gold. But Drool’s hands were on the Staff, not Lord Foul’s. The Despiser could not control who was summoned. So if you were chosen, you were chosen by the Creator….

  <p>Some men, whether out of desire for wealth, or fame, or power, or mere wanderlust, choose to be adventurers. But others are chosen, their paths guided by great powers toward heroic roads that lead them to everlasting glory—or ignominious death. A chosen can appear anywhere and at any time. The humblest farm boy is as likely to be marked by fate as the scion of a king. Chosen are, however, quite rare; fewer than 1 in 1,000 adventurers are chosen, and most people will live their entire lives without ever seeing one. When they do appear, they inevitably draw the attention of the great powers of light and darkness, ever ready to anoint a new champion or preemptively slay a new foe before he can come into the fullness of his power.</p>
  <p>To qualify as a chosen, a character must have at least one natural ability score of 18. The chosen’s prime requisite is his lowest ability score. Since a character must have an ability score of at least 9 in a class’s prime requisite(s) in order to choose a particular class, a character must have at least 9 in every ability score or he cannot become a chosen. A chosen must always be of Lawful alignment. A chosen who changes to Neutral or Chaotic alignment loses all his gifts. (At the Judge’s discretion, Chaotic chosen may be permitted, who work for the powers of darkness.)</p>
  <p>Chosen are blessed with an instinctive natural aptitude for combat. At first level, chosen hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. Whether from preternatural skill or uncanny link, chosen increase their base damage roll from successful melee and missile attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. A chosen can fight with a two-handed weapon, a weapon in each hand, or a weapon and shield, as desired.</p>
  <p>Despite their talents, most chosen begin their adventuring careers with limited knowledge of arms and armor. Chosen may only wear hide or lighter armor, and may only fight with bolas, clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, nets, slings, saps, and staffs. However, a chosen may use one or more gifts (see below) to train in the use of better armor or weapons, either at 1st level or later.</p>
  <p>Every chosen receives gifts from the powers that have chosen him. Some gifts reveal themselves in overtly magical displays; other gifts may manifest as merely an instinctive aptitude for learning of particular skills, enabling the chosen to master in mere months what takes others a lifetime to learn.</p>
  <p>At 1st level (Innocent), a chosen begins with three gifts. With each level of experienced gained thereafter, the number of gifts bestowed upon by the chosen increases, as shown on the Chosen Level Progression table.</p>
  <p>Just as each chosen has a different destiny, so each has a different set of gifts. Chosen select their gifts from the list below. All selections must be approved by the Judge. Some gifts may be banned from particular settings where they are inappropriate or where they refer to optional rules that the Judge has opted not to use. Chosen can only select the same gift multiple times at the same level with the Judge’s approval.</p>
  <h4 id="chosen-gifts">Chosen Gifts</h4>
  <p><em>Armor Training:</em> The chosen trains to fight in armor. This gift may be selected multiple times. If selected once, the chosen can wear leather armor. If selected twice, the chosen can wear chain mail armor. If selected thrice, the chosen can wear plate armor.</p>
  <p><em>Aura of Protection:</em> The chosen gains a +1 bonus to AC and a +1 bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. The chosen’s aura of protection appears as a golden halo when viewed with detect good, detect magic, or true seeing.</p>
  <p><em>Boon Companion:</em> Whenever an ally within 30’ makes an attack throw, proficiency throw, or saving throw, the chosen may spend a Fate Point to allow the ally to re-roll the throw. The chosen can spend additional Fate Points to allow further re-rolls if desired. However, the ally can never re-roll a natural 1.</p>
  <p><em>Ceremonial Magic:</em> The chosen has learned the ceremonies of a particular tradition of ceremonial magic (antiquarian, liturgical, runic, sylvan, shamanic, or theurgical). The chosen must choose the tradition at the time he chooses the gift. When this gift is selected, the chosen becomes a 1st level ceremonialist with a repertoire of one 1st level ceremony. He can perform ceremonies in the tradition and create and use trinkets and talismans in the tradition as a 1st level ceremonialist, and can identify trinkets or talismans created by a ceremonialist of the tradition with a proficiency throw of 11+ and of other traditions with an 18+. This gift can be selected multiple times. Each subsequent time it is selected, the chosen can either reduce the proficiency throw required to identify trinkets and talismans of a tradition he already knows by 4; learn another tradition; add one ceremony (of any level he can perform) to his repertoire; or increase his ceremonialist caster level by two, up to a maximum of his class level. Spells learned from other gifts (such as Eldritch Talent) are not included in the chosen’s repertoire of ceremonies.</p>
  <p><em>Charismatic Ferocity:</em> When attacking with one-handed melee weapons or thrown weapons, the chosen may apply his CHA modifier instead of his STR modifier on his damage rolls.</p>
  <p><em>Chosen Weapon:</em> The chosen can designate a particular individual weapon as his chosen weapon. The chosen weapon must be given a name (e.g. “Excalibur” or “Anduril”). When the chosen wields his chosen weapon, it is treated as if its magical bonus to attack and damage were 1 point greater. This gift may be selected multiple times, but no more than once at 1st to 4th level, twice at 5th to 9th level, and thrice at 10th level and above. Each time it is selected the chosen can increase the bonus of his chosen weapon or designate an additional weapon as a chosen weapon.</p>
  <p><em>Cleansing Touch:</em> By touching a creature and spending a Fate Point, the chosen can instantly remove a curse or dispel a harmful magical effect. The chosen must be of equal or greater level than the spellcaster who cast the curse or effect.</p>
  <p><em>Courage:</em> The chosen has mastered his fear and will never shirk from his destiny. He is immune to normal and magical fear effects.</p>
  <p><em>Destined:</em> The chosen gains two Fate Points. This gift may be selected multiple times.</p>
  <p><em>Determined:</em> The chosen may spend a Fate Point after making an attack throw, proficiency throw, or saving throw to set the result of the throw to 10 (instead of re-rolling). The chosen cannot spend a Fate Point in this manner if the original roll was a natural 1, however.</p>
  <p><em>Divine Proficiency:</em> The chosen can select one class proficiency, choosing from Divine Blessing, Divine Health, Laying on Hands, Prophecy, and Sensing Evil. This gift can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections. Note that some proficiencies available with this gift are not useful unless the chosen has selected the Eldritch Talent gift.</p>
  <p><em>Eldritch Talent:</em> The chosen manifests the ability to cast an eldritch spell at certain intervals. The spell selected may be of any level, up to the chosen’s level of experience. The spell is cast as if the chosen were of the minimum caster level for the spell. The frequency with which the chosen can cast is determined by the spells’ level. 1st – once per hour; 2nd – once per 8 hours; 3rd – once per day; 4th – once per week; 5th – once per month; 6th – once per year.  The chosen does not have a spellbook and cannot change his repertoire. This gift does not allow the chosen to use scrolls or magic items usable only by mages or clerics. This proficiency can be selected multiple times to gain the ability to cast additional spells. (In traditional ACKS campaigns, arcane or divine magic can be substituted for eldritch magic.)</p>
  <p><em>Eldritch Warrior:</em> When the chosen successfully strikes a target with a melee attack, he can expend a spell to increase damage. Damage is increased by 1d6 per level of the spell expended. The chosen must have gained spellcasting abilities from the Eldritch Talent gift before selecting this gift.</p>
  <p><em>Farseeing:</em> The chosen can see the fates of mortals. He may determine how many Fate Points a character has after 10 minutes (1 turn) of casual interaction or observation. Once per week, the chosen may cast fate (as the spell) with a casting time of 10 minutes (1 turn).</p>
  <p><em>Friends of Birds and Beasts:</em> The chosen can understand the subtle body language and moods of normal animals (though the animals may not understand the character). This gives the chosen a +2 to all reaction rolls when encountering normal animals, and allows him to take animals as henchmen. The chosen can also identify flora and fauna with a proficiency throw of 11+.</p>
  <p><em>Gift of Tongues:</em> The chosen has a gift for learning new tongues. Each time this gift is selected, he may learn four additional languages.</p>
  <p><em>Hard to Kill:</em> When a chosen is required to consult the Mortal Wounds table, the player may roll twice and choose the preferred result to apply.  The chosen also subtract his class level from the number of days of bed rest required to recover.</p>
  <p><em>Healing Touch:</em> By touching a creature and spending a Fate Point, the chosen can instantly heal the creature by an amount equal to his Base Healing Rate or the creature’s Base Healing Rate, whichever is less.</p>
  <p><em>Inspiring:</em> By reciting heroic lays or stirring words for a few moments before a battle (one round), a chosen can grant his allies within a 50' radius a +1 bonus to attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the character), and saving throws against magical fear. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). A chosen can inspire courage in any given character once per day per class level.  A chosen cannot inspire courage on characters who are already engaged in combat.</p>
  <p><em>Invulnerable:</em> The chosen is blessed with partial invulnerability  to harm. Any damage the chosen suffers from non-magical attacks is reduced by 1 point per die. The damage reduction is applied per die. Damage can be reduced to 0, but not less than 0, on each die. Attacks from monsters of 5 HD or more are considered magical attacks due to the monster’s ferocity. This gift can be selected up to three times. Each additional time the gift is selected, damage suffered is reduced by 1 additional point per die, to a maximum of 3 points per die.</p>
  <p><em>Lion-Hearted:</em> If the chosen is serving as a commander or hero on the battlefield with an army, the army automatically stands firm on its first morale roll, or rallies if it would have stood firm. This benefit is lost for the duration of the battle, however, if the chosen himself routs, flees, or leads from the rear (see Domains at War: Battles, p. 42).</p>
  <p><em>Lucky:</em> When re-rolling attack throws, proficiency throws, or saving throws using Fate Points, the chosen may roll the die twice and choose the better value.</p>
  <p><em>Keen Eyes:</em> The chosen can detect hidden and secret doors with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20 when actively searching, or 14+ on casual inspection.</p>
  <p><em>Magical Music:</em> The chosen gains the ability to sing spells. He gets two spell points and has one 1st level eldritch spell in his repertoire, which he casts as a 1st level spellsinger. This gift can be selected multiple times. Each time the gif its selected, the character can either increase his caster level by two, up to a maximum of his class level; or gain two spell points and add one additional eldritch spell (of any level he can spellsing) to his repertoire. Spells learned from other gifts (such as Eldritch Talent) are not included in the chosen’s repertoire of spellsinging spells.</p>
  <p><em>Magical Proficiency:</em> The chosen can select one class proficiency, choosing from Alchemy, Arcane Dabbling, Battle Magic, Collegiate Wizardry, Elementalism, Loremastery, Magical Engineering, Prestidigitation, Quiet Magic, Sensing Power, Soothsaying, Transmogrification, or Unflappable Casting. This gift can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections. Note that some proficiencies available with this gift are not useful unless the chosen has selected the Eldritch Talent gift.</p>
  <p><em>Martial Proficiency:</em> The chosen can select one class proficiency, choosing from Alertness, Blind Fighting, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery, Fighting Style, Precise Shooting, Skirmishing, Swashbuckling, Weapon Finesse, and Weapon Focus. This gift can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections.</p>
  <p><em>Martial Talent:</em> The chosen has a native aptitude for weapons. The chosen gains a +1 bonus to attack throws with his choice of either melee or missile attacks. This gift can be selected twice, once for melee and once for missile attacks.</p>
  <p><em>Martial Training:</em> The chosen has had training in use of arms. This gift may be selected multiple times. Each time it is selected, choose one of the following types of weapons and add these to the list of weapons permitted to the character: (1) axes; (2) bows/crossbows; (3) flails/hammers/maces; (4) swords/daggers; (5) spears/pole arms; (6) any four weapons.</p>
  <p><em>Meditative Focus:</em> The chosen can go into a state of intense Zen-like focus once per day per level of experience. While in focus, the character gains a +1 bonus to all attack throws, proficiency throws, saving throws, and initiative rolls. A meditative focus lasts for 1 turn (10 minutes).</p>
  <p><em>Military Genius:</em> The chosen commands the battlefield like a god of war. He gains a permanent +1 bonus to his strategic ability, leadership ability, and morale modifier when commanding troops on the battlefield.</p>
  <p><em>Mystical Bloodline:</em> The chosen is the scion of an otherworldly or inhuman power. When this gift is selected, the chosen’s lifespan is extend to three times longer than normal, and he ceases to show further signs of aging. He also gains the elf’s immunity to paralysis. When this gift is selected, the chosen’s ancestry manifests somehow in his appearance (pointed ears, golden eyes, a strange birthmark, or other unusual trait.)</p>
  <p><em>Scion of Kings:</em> The blood of ancient lords flows in the chosen’s veins. The character may hire one more henchman than his Charisma would otherwise permit, and the base morale score of any henchmen is increased by 1.</p>
  <p><em>Second Sight:</em> The chosen has a connection to the hidden world, and can see innately or magically invisible creatures within 60’. Invisible creatures are aware that the chosen can see them, and may often take a particular interest in him as a result. Second Sight does not provide the ability to see characters hiding in shadows, secret doors, traps, or other creatures or objects hidden through cover and concealment, but does provide a +4 bonus to saving throws to disbelieve illusions.</p>
  <p><em>Student of War:</em> The chosen can select one proficiency, choosing Command, Military Strategy, Leadership, or Siege Engineering. This gift can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency or proficiency rank each time.</p>
  <p><em>Sworn Foe:</em> When this gift is selected, the chosen must designate one specific individual monster or NPC by its name or unique physical characteristic (e.g. “the six-fingered man”). That creature becomes his sworn foe. The chosen gains a +2 bonus to attack throws and saving throws when confronting his sworn foe. If the chosen lands a successful attack on his sworn foe (including spells), the chosen can spend a Fate Point to deal double damage with the attack. If the sworn foe lands a successful attack on the chosen, the chosen can spend a Fate Point to halve the damage dealt by the attack. Once a chosen defeats his sworn foe, he may name a new sworn foe at any time thereafter. A sworn foe must have at least equal HD or levels of experience than the chosen; if the chosen ever surpasses his sworn foe in level or HD, he must select a new foe.</p>
  <p><em>Thievery Proficiency:</em> The chosen can select one class proficiency, choosing from Acrobatics, Alertness, Ambushing, Cat Burglary, Climbing, Contortionism, Eavesdropping, Lip Reading, Lockpicking, Passing Without Trace, Running, Skulking, and Trap Finding. This gift can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections.</p>
  <p><em>Thievery Training:</em> The chosen can select one thief skill, choosing from Find Traps, Hide in Shadows, Move Silently, Open Locks, Pick Pockets, and Remove Traps. Thereafter the chosen can perform this skill as a thief of his level. This proficiency may be selected multiple times to gain additional thief skills, to a maximum limit of three selections.</p>
  <p><em>Tribulating Adversary:</em> Whenever an enemy within 30’ makes an attack throw, proficiency throw, or saving throw, the chosen may spend a Fate Point to force the enemy to re-roll the throw. The chosen can spend additional Fate Points to allow further re-rolls if desired. However, the chosen can never force a re-roll of a natural 20.</p>
  <p><em>Wholeness of Body:</em> The chosen is immune to all forms of poison, including magical poisons.</p>
  <p>When a chosen reaches 5th level (Exemplar), his sense of destiny inspires others to follow him. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the chosen gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the chosen’s Charisma, proficiencies, or class powers.</p>
  <p>At 9th level (Chosen), a chosen can establish a stronghold and become a protector of men. When he does so, up to 1d4+1x10 0th level mercenaries will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries.</p>

  <p><em>Armed with holy water and aspergillus, and accompanied by many of the towns-people carrying torches, staves and halberds, the priest was led by Maspier to the place of the horror; and there they had found the body of Mazzal, with fearfully mangled face, and throat and bosom lined with bloody lacerations. The demoniac assailant had flown, and it was not seen or encountered again that night; but those who had beheld its work returned aghast to their homes, feeling that a creature of nethermost hell had come to visit the city, and perchance to abide therein. Consternation was rife on the morrow, when the story became generally known; and rites of exorcism against the invading demon were performed by the clergy in all public places and before thresholds.</em> – The Maker of Gargoyles (C. A. Smith)</p>

  <p>Ecclesiastics are human men and women dedicated to the service of a religious order. If your Judge has not specified particular religious orders in his campaign, the default ecclesiastic is assumed to be a member of the Temple of the Winged Sun, devoted to Ammonar, God of Law and Light. Whatever order they serve, the majority of ecclesiastics never adventure, preferring to dedicate themselves to ministry, prayer, and sacramental duties. Only a few venture forth from their parishes into the dangers of the world, traveling as mendicants, proselytizers, missionaries, or crusaders. Most of these ecclesiastics lose their lives or their faith to darkness or decadence. Those ecclesiastics who succeed in bringing the light of faith into dark places are recorded by later generations as saints and prophets of their god.
  Ecclesiastics receive little combat training. At first level, ecclesiastics hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws only two points every six levels of experience (i.e. the same as mages), but they advance in saving throws by two points every four levels of experience (i.e. as clerics). They may only fight with quarterstaffs, clubs, daggers, or darts. They are unable to use shields, fight with two weapons, or wear any kind of armor.
  Although they cannot cast spells like clerics, ecclesiastics may learn and perform eldritch ceremonies in the liturgical tradition starting at 1st level (Acolyte). An ecclesiastic’s selection of ceremonies is limited to the ceremonies in his repertoire. An ecclesiastic’s repertoire can include a number of eldritch ceremonies up to the number and level of ceremonies listed for his level, increased by his Intelligence bonus. More information on ceremonial magic, and individual spell descriptions, can be found in the <a href="Chapter05.md#chapter-5-heroic-magic">Heroic Magic</a> chapter.</p>
  <p>As they advance in level, ecclesiastics may add new ceremonies to their repertoire by visiting a temple of their order and spending one game week per ceremony. Each ecclesiastic’s order will require that the ecclesiastic learn particular ceremonies at each level, and will refuse to teach certain ceremonies it deems sacrilegious. Ecclesiastics who wish to learn such ceremonies must find or research them on their own. The specific ceremonies taught by any given order should be determined by the Judge based on his setting.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>EXAMPLE: Balbus, an ecclesiastic, has advanced to 2nd level, increasing his repertoire from one to two 1st level ceremonies. He visits the local Temple of the Winged Sun and impudently inquires of his Patriarch whether he might learn choking grip or weave smoke. After a stern lecture on upholding Light and Law, Balbus is offered a choice of illumination or command word.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Ecclesiastics must uphold the doctrines of their faith in order to remain members of their religious order. If an ecclesiastic is found breaking the rules of his order, he may be disciplined or even separated from his order. An ecclesiastic who is separated from his order may not return to the order when they advance in level to learn new ceremonies, and will not receive aid or followers when building a cathedral (see below). Other penalties are entirely up to the Judge.</p>
  <p>Ecclesiastics are among the most educated and respected members of their society. All ecclesiastics learn theology at a seminary or monastery (as per the Theology proficiency). They can automatically identify religious symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and holy days of their own faith, and can recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or occult cults may be harder to recognize (Judge’s discretion). An ecclesiastic may select additional ranks in the Theology proficiency to improve his proficiency throw if desired.</p>
  <p>Ecclesiastics can comfort and console the wounded, helping the faithful to better endure pain and suffering while they heal. Each use of the ability requires 1 turn (10 minutes), during which the target creature is reassured through prayer and pastoral guidance. Once comforted and consoled, the creature’s base healing rate from resting is doubled for the next day. An ecclesiastic cannot comfort and console wounded creatures of a different alignment or religion, nor can he comfort and console creatures of animal intelligence. This ability only applies to healing from resting. It does not stack with the effects of the salving rest spell nor with rallying the faithful.
  By reciting a sermon or singing a hymn of battle, an ecclesiastics can rally the faithful. Rallying the faithful requires  a few moments of oration (one round), and grants allied creatures within 30’ a pool of temporary hit points equal to the lower of the ecclesiastic’s or the subject’s base healing rate. These temporary hit points last for one turn (10 minutes) or until lost to damage, whichever comes first. To benefit from this spell, the subjects must either be of the same alignment and religion of the ecclesiastic, or must have personally benefited from his magic in the past. An ecclesiastic can rally the faithful once per day per level.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>EXAMPLE: Balbus, now a 5th level ecclesiastic, has a base healing rate of 1d8. He is adventuring with Athelstan (a paladin with 12 hp and a base healing rate of 1d4) and Raknar Red-Handed (a barbarian with 17 hp and a base healing rate of 1d6). The adventurers confront an ogre, which hits Raknar for 8 points of damage, reducing him to 9 hp. On his action, Balbus rallies the faithful, granting Athelstan and Balbus temporary hit points. Each character receives the temporary hit points equal to the lower of Balbus’ or their own base healing rate; for both characters that is their own healing rate. Athelstan rolls 1d4 and receives 2 temporary hit points, putting him at 12 hp and 2 temporary hp. Balbus rolls 1d6 and receives 6 temporary hp, putting him at 9 (of 17) hp and 6 temporary hp. These temporary hp will be lost first if the adventurers are hit. Otherwise they will last one turn.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Finally, all ecclesiastics have the ability to turn undead, calling upon the liturgy of their faith to drive back, and even destroy, undead. The potency of this ability is determined by level. On the Turning Undead table, there will be a dash, a “T”, a “D”, or a number corresponding to the type of undead monster and the level of the ecclesiastic. A dash means that the ecclesiastic has not attained high enough level to turn the undead type. A “T” means that the ecclesiastic automatically turns the undead, and a “D” means that the undead will be destroyed automatically. A number indicates that the player must roll that number or higher on 1d20 in order to turn the undead. If this roll is successful, or there is a “T” in the chart, the player rolls 2d6 and the result equals the number of total Hit Dice of undead monsters turned. A “D” in the chart requires the same roll to determine how many HD of undead are destroyed. No matter what the dice roll result, at least one undead monster will always be turned or destroyed, as appropriate, on a successful use of turning.</p>
  <p>Turned undead flee the area for 10 rounds by the best and fastest means available to them. If they cannot flee, they cower in terror, taking no actions and suffering a -2 penalty to AC. If the ecclesiastic attacks turned undead in melee combat, the turning effect is broken, but he can use spells or missile weapons against them, and other characters may attack them in any fashion, without breaking the turning effect. Destroyed undead are immediately turned to ash.</p>
  <p>There is no limit to how often an ecclesiastic may attempt to turn undead each day, but if an attempt to turn undead fails during an encounter, the ecclesiastic may not attempt to turn undead again for the remainder of that encounter.</p>
  <p>Certain chaotic sects teach their ecclesiastics to control undead rather than turn them. The undead are controlled for 1 turn per level of the character. If the undead would have been destroyed, the undead are controlled for 1 day per level of the ecclesiastic instead. Controlled undead behave as if charmed, obeying the ecclesiastic as if they were friends. However, if the controlled undead are turned or destroyed by an ecclesiastic during the duration of the control, the control is dispelled immediately. If the duration of the control ends without incident, the undead will flee (as if turned).</p>
  <p>An ecclesiastic can use any magic items usable by mages or clerics. When an ecclesiastic reaches 5th level (Vicar), he may begin to research spells, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. Ecclesiastics may collect and use divine power as clerics in order to fuel their magical research.
   
  At 9th level (Patriarch), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. Also upon attaining 9th level (Patriarch), an ecclesiastic may establish or build a cathedral. So long as the ecclesiastic is currently a member in good standing of his order, he may buy or build his cathedral at half the normal price due to aid from his order. Once a cathedral is established, the ecclesiastic’s reputation will spread and he will attract 5d6x10 0th level soldiers armed with various weapons, plus another 1d6 ecclesiastics of 1st-3rd level of the same religion to serve the order. They are completely loyal (morale +4). While in the ecclesiastic’s service, his followers must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. The Judge determines which proportions of followers are archers, infantry, etc. Ecclesiastic’s cathedrals are otherwise identical to cleric’s fortified temples, as detailed in the Campaign chapter of the ACKS Rulebook.</p>
  <p>At 11th level, an ecclesiastic may learn and cast ritual eldritch pells of great power (6th and 7th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical cross-breads. If chaotic, the ecclesiastic will become able to create necromantic servants and even become undead himself.</p>

  <p><em>In that hour Lúthien came, and standing upon the bridge that led to Sauron’s isle she sang a song that no walls of stone could hinder. Beren heard, and he thought that he dreamed; for the stars shone above him, and in the trees nightingales were singing. And in answer he sang a song of challenge… Then all strength left him and he fell down into darkness. But Lúthien heard his answering voice, and she sang then a song of greater power. The wolves howled, and the isle trembled.</em> – Of Beren and Lúthien, The Silmarillion (J.R.R. Tolkien)</p>

  <p>According to elven myth, the world began with a song – a mighty anthem sung by the gods themselves by which all things were created. Whether this myth is true, not even the wisest sages can say; but it is true that elf-song can carry great magical power, through which the world can be re-made in accordance with the will of the singer. Elves who have mastered this art are known as spellsingers, and they are counted among the mightiest of magicians. Though most elven spellsingers live out their long lives in the high fastnesses of their people, some enter the realms of men, called forth by a desire to experience awe and terror, a quest for rare and forgotten magic, or merely the lure of adventure.</p>
  <p>Elven spellsingers receive limited combat training. At first level, spellsingers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws only two points every six levels of experience (i.e. the same as mages), though they advance in saving throws by two points every four levels (i.e. as clerics). They may fight with daggers, swords, short swords, composite bows, long bows, and quarterstaffs. They may fight wielding a weapon two-handed but are unable to use shields, fight with two weapons, or wear any kind of armor.</p>
  <p>The voices of all elves sound lilting and lyrical to the ears of men; that of the spellsinger is beautiful enough to work magic. Every elven spellsinger begins with one rank of Perform (singing) proficiency; additional ranks may be accumulated as class or general proficiency selections. Because of her irresistible voice, an elven spellsinger gains a +2 bonus to reaction rolls with creatures she speaks to. If this bonus results in a total of 12 or more, the subjects act as if charmed while in her presence. Creatures with a WIS greater than the spellsinger’s CHA are immune to this power (and the elven spellsinger will know they are immune).</p>
  <p>All elven spellsingers practice the art of spellsinging from which they derive their name. Spellsinging is a method of casting eldritch spells by reciting lyrics laced with words of power. Spellsingers perform magic by spending spell points (SP)  rather than by expending daily spell castings. Each spell costs a certain number of spell points to sing. The higher the level of the spell, the more points it costs. The Spell Point Costs table describes each spell’s cost.  The spellsingers’ use of spell points gives them the flexibility to choose to cast a large number of low level spells, a small number of high level spells, or any combination in between. See <a href="Chapter05.md#spellsinging">Spellsinging</a> of the Heroic Magic chapter for details on spellsinging.</p>

  <p>Spellsingers recover their spell points in the same way spellcasters recover their daily spell castings, by spending eight hours resting without interruption and one hour concentrating on prayer or study. Spell points can only be recovered by resting once every 24 hours. Spellsingers can also tap ambient magic to fuel their spells without expending their own SPs. See <a href="Chapter05.md#tapping-power">Tapping Power</a> of the Heroic Magic chapter for details on tapping ambient magic.</p>
  <p>Like other eldritch casters, a spellsinger’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his repertoire. A spellsinger’s repertoire can include a number of spells up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intelligence bonus, and functions exactly like an arcane/eldritch caster’s repertoire in all respects. Unlike other casters, however, spellsingers can cast spells that are not in their repertoire by extemporaneously singing spells. See <a href="Chapter05.md#extemporaneous-spellsinging">Extemporaneous Spellsinging</a> of the Heroic Magic chapter for details on extemporaneous spellsinging.</p>
  <p>When an elven spellsinger reaches 5th level (Spellbinder), she may begin to research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions. Elven spellsingers may collect and use divine power as clerics in order to fuel their magical research. When an elven spellsinger reaches 9th level (Spellsinger), she is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.</p>
  <p>At 9th level, an elven spellsinger can also establish a fastness in a natural setting, such as a forest or glen. Rather than impose upon nature, this keep must blend seamlessly with it. A total of 3d6x10 1st level elven NPCs will move in to help with it and defend the fastness at no cost to the character. Additional rules for elven fastnesses are detailed in the Campaign chapter of ACKS.</p>
  <p>At 11th level, an elven spellsinger may learn and cast ritual spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical cross-breeds. If chaotic, the spellsinger may create necromantic servants and become undead, though such a choice is understandably rarer among the ageless elves.</p>
  <p>Like other elves, spellsingers gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness due to their attunement to nature. Elves have keen eyes that allow them to detect hidden and secret doors with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20 when actively searching, or 14+ on casual inspection. Because of their connection to nature, elves are completely unaffected by the paralysis ghouls can inflict, and the target values for all their saving throws versus Petrification/Paralysis and Spells are reduced by 1. (These adjustments are already factored into the saving throws on the table below.) All elves can speak the Common, Elven, Gnoll, Hobgoblin, and Orc languages.</p>

  <p>Freebooters are a motley assortment of adventurers who live and die for plunder. Some freebooters are dauntless expeditionaries who raid tombs for ancient treasures. Others may be brutal ruffians who rob and ravage the weak and foolish, cunning scoundrels with the charisma to convince their marks to hand over their wealth willingly, or hardy wayfarers who exact a toll on any who cross the roads and trails of their wilderness homes. Whatever their particular path to plunder, wayfarers share a lust for adventure, a taste for gold, and a willingness to resort to subterfuge and backhanded tactics without hesitation.</p>
  <p>Like thieves, freebooters often belong to a criminal guild which offers shelter and information between heists. At the Judge’s discretion, a freebooter may have to forfeit a portion of his earnings to the guild in exchange for protection. In the Auran Empire, freebooters are everywhere, from the slums of the ports of Kushtu to the highest halls of the Senate in Aura.</p>
  <p>Freebooters are ruthless, dirty combatants. At first level, freebooters hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws by two points every three levels of experience. However they advance in saving throws like thieves, by two points every four levels of experience.</p>
  <p>All freebooters may wear leather armor or lighter, and may wield crossbows, daggers, shortbows, short swords, and swords, as well as five other weapons determined by their path (see below). They may fight wielding a weapon two-handed and wielding a weapon in each hand, but may not use shields.  They may only use magic items usable by thieves.</p>
  <p>Lacking the staying power of fighters, freebooters prefer to strike from ambush and finish their foes quickly. A freebooter whose opponent is unaware of his presence can backstab him. When backstabbing, the freebooter receives an attack bonus of +4 and, if successful, deals additional damage for every four levels he has attained. A freebooter at 1st through 4th levels does double the normal damage, at 5th-8th levels does triple the normal damage, at 9th-12th levels does quadruple the normal damage, and at 13th level or higher does quintuple the normal damage.</p>
  <p>Freebooters increase their damage from their choice of either missile or melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. The freebooter must choose which type of attack will receive the damage bonus at 1st level, and may not change the choice as he advances (i.e. they may choose to be either melee or missile specialists).</p>
  <p>A freebooter’s plundering pursuits are shaped by his path to wealth. There are four paths to wealth available to a freebooter: Expeditionary, Ruffian, Scoundrel, and Wayfarer. Each path offers a different set of abilities reflecting that path’s preferred methods to accumulate wealth. When a freebooter is created, select a path for the character from the Paths to Wealth table below, and write down the proficiencies and powers of the path. Each path teaches the use of a selection of five additional weapons, trains the character in four thief skills, and grants five bonus proficiencies. Note that each path has its own prime requisite in addition to DEX.</p>

  <p>At the Judge’s discretion, a freebooter may follow a unique path, outside of the four listed above. The player and Judge should collaborate to choose five weapons, four thief skills, and five bonus proficiencies that are appropriate to the freebooter.</p>
  <h4 id="path-of-expeditionary">Path of Expeditionary</h4>
  <p>Prime Requisite: WIS<br>
  Weapons:  hand axe, pole arm, spear, staff, war hammer<br>
  Thief Skills:  find traps, open locks, move silently, remove traps<br>
  Bonus Proficiencies:  Alertness, Climbing, Dungeon Bashing, Mapping, Trap Finding</p>
  <p>The expeditionary is a looter of tombs and a delver of dungeons. He often serves as point-man on dungeon delves due to his ability to find both secret doors and traps more effectively than almost any other adventurer. His ability to climb walls and move silently allows him to scout ahead undetected by listening guards, while his training in disarming traps, opening locks, and bashing doors enables him to penetrate almost any obstacle in his path to plunder. Expeditionaries are also excellent map-makers and most treasure maps are created by them.</p>
  <h4 id="path-of-ruffian">Path of Ruffian</h4>
  <p>Prime Requisite: STR <br>
  Weapons: battle axe, club, morning star, sap, whip<br>
  Thief Skills: hide in shadows, move silently, open locks, pick pockets<br>
  Bonus Proficiencies: Dungeon Bashing, Fighting Style (ruffian’s choice), Intimidation, Skulking, Swashbuckling</p>
  <p>The ruffian is a cut-throat and killer. A ruffian can cut the purses of passersby, skulk in the shadows to waylay unsuspecting victims, break into homes and burglarize their valuables, or simply rely on his threatening demeanor and martial prowess to rob victims at sword-point. Most freebooters are ruffians, and they can be found in great numbers in any den of scum and villainy.</p>
  <h4 id="path-of-scoundrel">Path of Scoundrel</h4>
  <p>Prime Requisite: CHA<br>
  Weapons: arbalest, dart, mace, sap, whip<br>
  Thief Skills: hide in shadows, move silently, open locks, pick pockets<br>
  Bonus Proficiencies: Cat Burglary, Climbing, Disguise, Eavesdropping, Lip Reading</p>
  <p>The scoundrel is a gentleman thief. His ability to scale walls, open locks, hide in shadows, and move silently enables him to function as nigh-undetectable cat burglar, stealing his victims’ most precious treasures without need for violence. An expert in disguise, he can blend in to any crowd, where his graceful sleight-of-hand can relieve his marks of their important papers and burdensome purses. Skilled eavesdroppers and lip readers, scoundrels often work as spies and secret agents, uncovering secrets that the powerful wish to keep hidden.</p>
  <h4 id="path-of-wayfarer">Path of Wayfarer</h4>
  <p>Prime Requisite: CON<br>
  Weapons: bola, hand axe, longbow, net, staff<br>
  Thief Skills: climb walls, hear noise, hide in shadows, move silently<br>
  Bonus Proficiencies: Land Surveying, Running, Sniping, Skirmishing, Tracking</p>
  <p>The wayfarer is a highwayman, outrider, and scout. He excels at hit-and-run attacks, sniping from the cover of darkness and brush, then falling back swiftly and silently into the wilderness. He has the ability to move through the wilderness at great speed, and can navigate mountainous terrain, climb trees, and scale precipices that halt pursuers. If inclined to law, wayfarers may use their expertise in tracking and land surveying to discover monster lairs in the wilderness for adventuring parties or local garrisons.</p>
  <p>While each path of freebooter knows different thief skills, all follow the same progression of improvement, as shown on the Freebooter (Thief) Skill Progression table, below.</p>
  <p>When a freebooter attains 9th level (Freebooter Captain), he can establish a hideout, and 2d6 freebooter apprentices of 1st level will come to work with the character. The freebooters will be of the same path as their captain. If hired, they must be paid standard rates. Additional rules for hideouts are detailed in the Campaign chapter.</p>
  <p>Freebooter Proficiency List: Acrobatics, Alertness, Arcane Dabbling, Blind Fighting, Bribery, Cat Burglary, Ceremonial Magic, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery (disarm, incapacitate), Contortionism, Fighting Style, Lip Reading, Lockpicking, Loremastery, Magical Music, Martial Training, Mountaineering, Passing Without Trace, Precise Shooting, Running, Skirmishing, Skulking, Sniping, Swashbuckling, Trap Finding, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus*</p>

  <p><em>The Shirriffs was the name that [halflings] gave to their police… There were in all the Shire only twelve of them, three in each Farthing. A rather larger body, varying at need, was employed ‘to beat the bounds’, and to see that Outsiders of any kind, great or small, did not makes themselves a nuisance. At the time when this story begins, the Bounders, as they were called, had been greatly increased. There were many reports and complaints of strange persons and creatures prowling about the borders, or over them: the first sign that all was not quite as it should be, and always had been except in tales and legends of long ago.!</em> - The Fellowship of the Rings (J.R.R. Tolkien)</p>
  <p>Halflings are a race of diminutive and insular humanoids noted for their love of food, wealth, and comfort and their dislike of big people, strangers, and travel. Descending from human and dwarven stock, they stand about 3’ tall, with ruddy skin, dark hair, and brown or black eyes.  Among the most hirsute of the humanoid races, halflings cultivate their body hair the way dwarves cultivate their beards. Well-groomed foot hair is the mark of a halfling of fine breeding. Halflings live in hill burrows with big, round windows which are known as a “halfling holes”, and are a compromise between a dwarven heritage that craves the security of thick earth overhead and a human bloodline clamoring for sun and space. Halflings organize themselves in small, close-knit communities known as shires, typically made up of 500 to 600 halflings but sometimes having as many as 3,000 denizens.</p>
  <p>The safety and security of the shire is entrusted to the bounders, a militia-like organization of volunteers that watch over the areas outside the shire, and help keep order within. Bounders tend to be among the biggest and boldest halflings around, and as such are more likely than other members of their homebodied race to be found as adventurers. Some bounders adventure from an excess of wanderlust, others in order to bring to justice a trespasser against the shire, and others in order to gain the wealth needed to become respected gentlemen of their community.</p>
  <p>Halfling bounders are the best-trained combatants of their race. At first level, bounders hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience (i.e. the same as fighters). In addition, they gain an accuracy bonus of +1 to all attack throws with missile weapons.</p>
  <p>They are trained with battle axes, bolas, crossbows, daggers, hand axes, javelins, slings, short bows, short swords, and swords. They can fight with a small weapon and halfling-size shield, with a small weapon in each hand, or with a medium-sized weapon used  two-handed. Due to their careful aim, they increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd and 6th level. Bounders can wear any armor.</p>
  <p>Despite their combat training, halfling bounders prefer not to confront powerful enemies alone. A bounder may instead placate his opponents use disarming  words, glib talk, or submissive body language, until help arrives. The bounder may not attack while placating, but may walk at half speed, or perform an action in lieu of moving, such as standing up from being knocked down, picking an item off the ground, or retrieving an item from a pack or sack. A halfling bounder may not placate if he, or any other halflings in his party, have already attacked an opponent during the present encounter.</p>
  <p>When a halfling bounder is placating, any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack him must attempt a saving throw versus Spells. If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack the halfling bounder normally that round. If the save fails, the opponent will not attack the bounder that round and will attack another creature instead. Area effects may still affect the halfling. Mindless creatures and fantastic creatures of animal intelligence cannot be placated, but ordinary animals and all sapient creatures are susceptible to a halfling burglar's cringing placation.</p>
  <p>Halfling bounders are ever alert for threats to their shire. Their nervous watchfulness grants bounders a +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus against surprise. As they must constantly patrol the perimeter of the shire, halfling bounders learn to maintain a bounding march that affords them a movement rate of 120’ per turn and 24 miles per day.</p>
  <p>Like burglars, halfling bounders are difficult to spot outdoors, having the ability to seemingly disappear into woods and underbrush with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. In dungeons, a halfling bounder who is motionless and quiet in cover can escape detection with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20.</p>
  <p>All halflings are perceived as child-like by members of the larger races. A halflings suffer a -2 penalty to loyalty and morale with non-halfling henchman, but gains a +2 bonus to loyalty and morale with halfling henchman. This modifier does not affect their reaction rolls, as some people like kids.</p>
  <p>Due to their dwarven ancestry, halflings gain a +1 bonus on saving throws versus Petrification/Paralysis and Spells. These adjustments are already factored into the saving throws on the Halfling Burglar Attack and Saving Throws table below.</p>
  <p>As naturally chatty folk, all halfling characters will speak the Common tongue, their native tongue, and three bonus languages, selected from the following list based on their shire’s proximity to other races and realms: Bugbear, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goblin, Human (various), Hobgoblin, Kobold, Orc.</p>
  <p>Halflings have notoriously large appetites and are famous for their heroic breakfasts. Once per day a halfling can recover his base healing rate in hp by consuming a meal accompanied by alcohol, coffee, or tea. This recovery is in addition to any hit points gained from complete rest.</p>
  <p>Halfling crave comfort and security far too much to be able to descend into dastardly wickedness. They are difficult to corrupt, suffering only ½ the usual amount of Corruption from spending time in <a href="Chapter05.md#sinkholes-of-evil">sinkholes of evil</a>, using <a href="Chapter05.md#corruption">evil magic items</a>, or from the effects of <a href="Chapter05.md#corrupting-dream">corrupting dreams</a>.</p>
  <p>While spiritually strong, halflings are physically weak and suffer a -4 penalty to proficiency throws to open doors and other feats of strength. For the same reason halflings are easily encumbered. They can only carry 3 stone without becoming encumbered. When carrying 4 stone their encounter movement rate is reduced to 90’. When carrying 5-6 stone, their encounter movement rate is reduced to 60’. When carrying 7 stone or more, their encounter movement rate is reduced to 30’. A halfling can carry a maximum of 12 stone, modified by his Strength bonus or penalty.</p>
  <p>Because of their small size, halflings can get underfoot of large, clumsy creatures. Monsters of larger than man-sized suffer a -2 penalty to their attack throws against halflings.</p>
  <p>Halfling bounders cannot attain 9th level, and therefore never attract followers by establishing a stronghold.</p>

  <p><em>His small hand would not close about it for it was a large and heavy gem; but he lifted it, shut his eyes, and put it in his deepest pocket. &quot;Now I am a burglar indeed!&quot; thought he. &quot;But I suppose I must tell the dwarves about it-some time.

  <p>Legend has it that the first halfling burglar was nothing of the sort, merely some hapless shire-dweller drawn into an expedition by the machinations of a meddlesome Nobiran wizard and a band of dwarven delvers. Legend also has it that the halfling later returned home from his expeditions richer than any halfling in history and established himself as a leading gentleman in his shire. The tale has two endings; in the happy version of the tale, the halfling burglar ended his years in luxurious retirement, training his nephew and nephew’s friends in the tricks he had learned. The tragic ending claims that the burglar was corrupted by dark magic and abandoned his friends and family to dwell forever in cavernous darkness.</p>
  <p>Learned sages are confident this story is just a faery-tale, and that no such halfling ever existed. Nevertheless, the tale’s influence has been profound. More than one young halfling, despite belonging to a race utterly unsuited for adventuring, has left the comforts of his family hobbit-hole to seek out fame and fortune. Of course, most of these halflings are never seen again, but sometimes – not often, mind you, but just often enough – a halfling burglar will return, baggage laden with gold, brimming with tales of adventurer and excitement. Such halflings typically establish themselves as bourgeois gentlemen in their shire, and furtively train other young halflings in their skills. Their disciples may in time become adventurers themselves, though as often as not they simply use their craft to trespass, annoy, and meddle in the affairs of their betters. More law-abiding halflings are thus quick to point out to visiting strangers where “that sort” can be found, and generally cheer when they are recruited to join adventuring parties.</p>
  <p>Halfling burglars are good combatants, as far as halflings go, although not as skilled as halfling bounders. At first level, burglars hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience (i.e. the same as thieves). They are trained with bolas, daggers, darts, slings, short bows, and short swords. They can fight with a halfling-size shield or with a weapon in each hand, but cannot fight two-handed.</p>
  <p>Burglars never wear armor heavier than leather. Because they stay constantly light on their feet, all halfling burglars gain Swashbuckling as a bonus proficiency, providing a +1 bonus to AC at 1st level, increasing to +2 AC at 7th level.</p>
  <p>When outdoors, halfling burglars are difficult to spot, having the ability to seemingly disappear into woods and underbrush with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. In dungeons, a halfling who is motionless and quiet in cover can escape detection with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20.</p>
  <p>When confronted by enemies, a halfling burglar may placate them use disarming  words, glib talk, or submissive body language to avoid being attacked. The burglar may not attack while placating, but may walk at half speed, or perform an action in lieu of moving, such as standing up from being knocked down, picking an item off the ground, or retrieving an item from a pack or sack. A halfling burglar may not placate if he, or any other halflings in his party, have already attacked an opponent during the present encounter.</p>
  <p>When a halfling burglar is placating, any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack him must attempt a saving throw versus Spells. If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack the halfling burglar normally that round. If the save fails, the opponent will not attack the burglar that round and will attack another creature instead. Area effects may still affect the halfling. Mindless creatures and fantastic creatures of animal intelligence cannot be placated, but ordinary animals and all sapient creatures are susceptible to a halfling burglar's cringing placation.</p>
  <p>Uncharitable human adventurers often claim that a halfling burglar’s abilities are limited to dodging, hiding, and pleading for his life. In actuality, halfling burglars have a range of other skills that are useful for trespassing, pilfering, eavesdropping, or being a meddling nuisance. These skills improve as the burglar gains levels according to the progression on the Halfling Burglar Skills table, below.</p>
  <p>All halflings are perceived as child-like by members of the larger races. A halflings suffer a -2 penalty to loyalty and morale with non-halfling henchman, but gains a +2 bonus to loyalty and morale with halfling henchman. This modifier does not affect their reaction rolls, as some people like kids.</p>
  <p>Due to their dwarven ancestry, halflings gain a +1 bonus on saving throws versus Petrification/Paralysis and Spells. These adjustments are already factored into the saving throws on the Halfling Burglar Attack and Saving Throws table below.</p>
  <p>As naturally chatty folk, all halfling characters will speak the Common tongue, their native tongue, and three bonus languages, selected from the following list based on their shire’s proximity to other races and realms: Bugbear, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goblin, Human (various), Hobgoblin, Kobold, Orc.</p>
  <p>Halflings have notoriously large appetites and are famous for their heroic breakfasts. Once per day a halfling can recover his base healing rate in hp by consuming a meal accompanied by alcohol, coffee, or tea. This recovery is in addition to any hit points gained from complete rest.</p>
  <p>Halfling crave comfort and security far to much to be able to descend into dastardly wickedness. They are difficult to corrupt, suffering only ½ the usual amount of Corruption from spending time in <a href="Chapter05.md#sinkholes-of-evil">sinkholes of evil</a>, using <a href="Chapter05.md#corruption">evil magic items</a>, or from the effects of <a href="Chapter05.md#corrupting-dream">corrupting dreams</a>.</p>
  <p>While spiritually resilient, halflings are physically weak and suffer a -4 penalty to proficiency throws to open doors and other feats of strength. For the same reason halflings are easily encumbered. They have a base movement rate of just 90’ and can only carry 3 stone without becoming encumbered. When carrying 4 stone their encounter movement rate is reduced to 60’. When carrying 5-6 stone, their encounter movement rate is reduced to 45’. When carrying 7 stone or more, their encounter movement rate is reduced to 30’. A halfling can carry a maximum of 12 stone, modified by his Strength bonus or penalty.</p>
  <p>Because of their small size, halflings can get underfoot of large, clumsy creatures. Monsters of larger than man-sized suffer a -2 penalty to their attack throws against halflings.</p>
  <p>When a burglar attains 9th level (Bourgeois Burglar), he can establish a hidey-hole, and 2d6 halfling burglar apprentices of 1st level will offer to work for him. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for ruffians. Many burglars use these followers to start a profitable crime syndicate, and thereafter stay at home, get fat, and pretend to be respectable bourgeoisie of their shire. A burglar’s hidey-hole is otherwise identical to a thief’s hideout. See the Hideouts &amp; Hijinks section of Chapter 7 of ACKS.</p>

  <p>Loremasters pursue knowledge and preserve ancient wisdom handed down from time immemorial. Most loremasters live ascetic lives devoted to annotating and studying the books and scrolls collected by their predecessors. But the boldest and most ambitious become adventurers, delving into the dungeons and tombs of past kingdoms in search of knowledge which has been lost. Wielding secrets forgotten for centuries, these loremasters become the most powerful of their kind, legends whose deeds will become the subject of study by the annalists of the future.</p>
  <p>Because of their devotion to study, loremasters receive limited combat training. At first level, loremasters hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws only two points every six levels of experience (i.e. half as fast as fighters), though they advance in saving throws by two points every four levels (i.e. as clerics). They may only fight with quarterstaffs, clubs, daggers, and darts. They are unable to use shields, fight with two weapons, or wear any kind of armor. For these reasons, loremasters are quite vulnerable to physical danger, and in an adventuring group they should be protected.</p>
  <p>The books and scrolls of interest to the loremaster are virtually never written in the Common tongue so loremasters soon become familiar with even the most obscure scripts, codes, and languages. At 1st level, a loremaster may read languages unfamiliar to them (including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings) with a proficiency throw of 5+ on 1d20. If the roll does not succeed, the loremaster may not try to read that particular piece of writing until he reaches a higher level of experience.</p>
  <p>From careful study of ancient annals and legends, loremasters can decipher occult mysteries, remember ancient history, identify historic artifacts, and similar tasks. At 1st level, a loremaster must make a proficiency throw of 18+ on 1d20 to succeed in loremastery. The proficiency throw for loremastery reduces by 1 per level.</p>
  <p>Most importantly, the scholarly pursuits of loremasters allow them to learn and perform eldritch ceremonies in the theurgical tradition. A loremaster’s selection of ceremonies is limited to the ceremonies in his repertoire. A loremaster’s repertoire can include a number of eldritch ceremonies up to the number and level of ceremonies listed for his level, increased by his Intelligence bonus. A loremaster can use any magic items usable by mages or clerics, and can make trinkets to aid his performance of ceremonies. More information on ceremonial magic, and individual spell descriptions, can be found in the <a href="Chapter05.md#ceremonial-magic">Heroic Magic chapter</a>.</p>
  <p>As they advance in level, loremasters may add new ceremonies to their repertoire by visiting an athenaeum or other place of learning (see below) and spending one game week per ceremony. Particular athenaeums may only offer particular ceremonies at each level, either due to the limitations of their libraries or doctrinal beliefs. Loremasters who wish to learn unavailable ceremonies must find or research them on their own. The specific ceremonies taught at any given athenaeum should be determined by the Judge based on his setting.</p>
  <p>As part of his training in ceremonial magic, every loremaster creates a personal talisman to aid him in performing ceremonies. The  loremaster’s personal talisman provides a +1 bonus to ceremony throws for ceremonies of one particular type. (The loremaster may choose from death &amp; necromancy; detection; elemental air; elemental earth; elemental fire; elemental water; enchantment &amp; illusion; healing; movement; protection; summoning; and transmogrification). When the loremaster advances to 3rd level, his personal talisman can increase its bonus by +1 for ceremonies of one particular type (e.g. increase the bonus to +2 for the current type or add a bonus of +1 with a new type). When the loremaster reaches 11th level, his personal talisman can increase its bonus by another +1 for ceremonies of one particular type (e.g. increase a +2 bonus to +3 for a current type, or increase a +1 bonus to +2 for a current type, or add a bonus of +1 with a new type). If desired, the loremaster may increase the bonus afforded by, or number of ceremony types covered by, his personal talisman by  selecting the <a href="#personal-talisman">Personal Talisman proficiency</a>. More information on talismans can be found in the <a href="Chapter05.md#ceremonial-talismans">Ceremonial Talismans</a> section of the Heroic Magic chapter.</p>
  <p>When a loremaster reaches 5th level (Scholar), he may begin to research ceremonies, scribe scrolls, brew potions, and make talismans. Loremasters may collect and use divine power as clerics in order to fuel their magical research.</p>
  <p>When a loremaster reaches 9th level (Loremaster), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. A loremaster may also build an athenaeum, typically a great library, when he reaches 9th level. He will then attract 1d6 apprentices of 1st-3rd level plus 2d6 normal men seeking to become loremasters. Their intelligence scores will be above average, but many will become discouraged from the rigorous mental training and quit after 1d6 months. While in the loremaster’s service, apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. If the loremaster builds a menagerie beneath or near his athenaeum, monsters may be collected therein. Loremaster’s athenaeum and menageries are otherwise identical to mages’ sanctums and dungeons, as detailed in the Campaign chapter of the ACKS Rulebook.</p>
  <p>At 11th level, a loremaster may create learn and cast ritual eldritch spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical cross-breeds. If chaotic, the loremaster may create necromantic servants and become undead.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Nobirans are a race of divinely-blessed men from the Auran Empire campaign setting. Outside of the Auran Empire campaign setting, Nobirans could be used to model any demi-human race of exceptional power and nobility, such as the half-human, half-divine demigods of Greek myth, the Aasimar of the Forgotten Realms, or the Dúnedain of Tolkien’s Middle Earth. In settings where normal men cannot become spellcasters, Nobirans can also represent those mortals born with a gift for magical talent arising from benign or divine sources.</p>
  <p>Civilization is ever under threat – barbarians, beastmen, the very forces of Chaos itself ever assail the realms of man. Against these threats, the Nobiran champion stands firm and ever-watchful, shield high and sword in hand. Descended from the very heroes who first carved the realm from the wilderness, Nobiran champions are sometimes found among the old nobility, but most are lonely wanderers who protect realms that have forgotten their kings of old.</p>
  <p>Some Nobiran champions eventually become renowned for their glorious deeds and claim high places as leaders of men. Others, scorned by the very people they defend, defect to the Enemy and become terrible foes of the realm. Most die in forlorn battles, remembered only by the brothers, sons, and comrades who pick up the swords of the fallen and continue to fight the long defeat.</p>
  <p>Nobiran champions are raised to be warriors from a young age. At first level, champions hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. All Nobiran champions may wear chainmail armor or lighter, and may wield daggers, lances, javelins, pole arms, spears, short swords, swords, and two-handed-swords, as well as five other weapons determined by their calling (see below). They may fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a weapon two-handed, and wielding a weapon in each hand.  They may use any magic item usable by fighters.</p>
  <p>Nobiran champions increase their damage from their choice of either missile or melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. The champion must choose which type of attack will receive the damage bonus at 1st level, and may not change the choice as he advances (i.e. they may choose to be either melee or missile specialists).</p>
  <p>A champion’s martial talents are shaped by his calling of arms. There are three callings of arms available to a champion: Armiger, Herald, and Ranger. Each calling offers a different set of abilities reflecting that calling’s specific viewpoint on the duties of a champion. When a Nobiran champion is created, select a calling for the character from the Calling of Arms table below, and write down the proficiencies and powers of the calling. Each calling teaches the use of a selection of five additional weapons, adds four proficiency selections to the Nobiran Champion Proficiency List as potential class proficiency choices, and unlocks four special abilities earned as the character advances in level.</p>

  <h4 id="calling-of-armiger">Calling of Armiger</h4>
  <p>Class Proficiencies: Combat Trickery (knock down), Dungeon Bashing, Martial Training, Riding<br>
  Weapons: battle axe, flail, great axe, morning star, war hammer</p>
  <p>1st level: The armiger has devoted himself to the study of armored combat. This armor training permits him to wear banded, lamellar, and/or plate armor rather than just chainmail.</p>
  <p>3rd level: Years of fighting in a panoply of steel has taught the armiger to endure heavy loads. He reduces his effective encumbrance by 2 stone for purposes of determining his movement rate.</p>
  <p>7th level: The armiger has learned to mitigate damage by absorbing the blow on his armor or shield. When an armiger mitigates damage, the damage dealt by the attack is reduced to 1 point. The excess damage is absorbed by the armiger’s armor or shield, which is reduced in effectiveness (AC) by 1 point per 10 points of damage mitigated (rounded up). In addition, if the amount of damage mitigated is greater than the armiger’s current hit points, then he is also knocked prone. The armiger cannot mitigate damage if he is backstabbed, frightened, helpless, infuriated, mesmerized, prone, surprised, or stunned. Special maneuvers cannot be mitigated, nor can damage from critical hits, magic, or area of effect attacks. Armor and/or shields that are reduced to 0 or less effectiveness are ruined and cannot be repaired. Otherwise an armorer with a workshop can repair the damage to an armiger’s armor and shield at a cost of 10gp per point of effectiveness.</p>
  <p>11th level: The armiger is a lion-hearted leader whose courage inspires his men to fight on. If the armiger is fighting on the battlefield with an army, the army automatically stands firm on its first morale roll, or rallies if it would have stood firm. This benefit is lost for the duration of the battle, however, if the armiger himself routs, flees, or leads from the rear (see Domains at War: Battles, p. 42).</p>
  <h4 id="calling-of-herald">Calling of Herald</h4>
  <p>Class Proficiencies: Armor Training, Leadership, Mystic Aura, Siege Engineering<br>
  Weapons: battle axe, composite bow, flail, mace, war hammer</p>
  <p>1st level: The herald has the ability to inspire courage. Inspiring courage requires  a few moments of oration (one round), and grants the herald’s allies within a 50' radius a +1 bonus to attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the character), and saving throws against magical fear. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). The herald can inspire courage in any given character once per day per class level. The herald cannot inspire courage in characters who are already engaged in combat or in characters of different alignment.</p>
  <p>3rd level:. As an envoy to lords and rulers, the herald has become conversant in the tongues of all the great civilizations. The character gains the ability to speak, read, and write four bonus languages. The languages chosen must be in common use by his realm’s historical allies or enemies (Judge’s discretion).</p>
  <p>7th level: The herald knows that the greatest victories come without fighting. In lieu of moving or attacking on his initiative, the herald may demand surrender from a group of hostile creatures. The group can be of any size, but the creatures must be able to see, hear, and understand the herald, and must be either outnumbered or surprised by the herald and his allies in order to be affected. Affected creatures must make an immediate morale roll with a penalty equal to the herald’s CHA bonus. A result of Retreat or Fighting Withdrawal will lead to their immediate surrender. If the demand fails, a herald may not demand surrender from the same creature or creatures again until other circumstances have triggered a morale roll by the creature or creatures. This ability can be used at the start of a D@W battle if the opposing army is surprised or outnumbered by the herald’s army.</p>
  <p>11th level: The herald is a clarion commander who can rouse the populace in times of danger. When the herald issues a call to arms to his vassals, he can ask them to muster their full garrison without provoking a Henchman Morale roll. When the herald levies the peasant militia of his domain, or when his vassals levy their militias in response to his call to arms, morale of the domain does not suffer a penalty. All militia levied by the herald, or by his vassals in response to the herald’s call to arms, gain a +1 bonus to their morale scores, for the duration of the call. (This bonus does not stack if both the ruler and a vassal are heralds.)</p>
  <h4 id="calling-of-ranger">Calling of Ranger</h4>
  <p>Class Proficiencies: Ambushing, Land Surveying, Precise Shooting, Sniping<br>
  Weapons: composite bow, hand axe, long bow, staff, short bow</p>
  <p>1st level: The ranger is difficult to spot in the wilderness, having the ability to seemingly disappear into woods and underbrush with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. In dungeons, the ranger can escape detection with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20 if he remains quiet and motionless.</p>
  <p>3rd level: Years of pursuing his foe have taught the ranger to be a highly proficient tracker. He gains the Tracking proficiency, if he does not have it already. If he already has one or more ranks of Tracking, then this class power grants the ranger the ability to move at full speed while tracking.</p>
  <p>7th level: The ranger is an expert scout trained to find monster lairs in the wilderness (see Lairs &amp; Encounters, p. 13). When searching a hex, the ranger receives a searching throw to discover a lair every 30 minutes instead of every hour (or every 15 minutes if aerial). When first arriving in a hex, the ranger may attempt to assess the total number of lairs in the hex as if he had Land Surveying proficiency. If the ranger already has or later gains Land Surveying, this class power stacks with the proficiency to grant the ranger a +4 bonus to his assessment throws.</p>
  <p>11th level: The ranger is a cunning and flexible reconnoiter who excels in scouting and screening the enemy. Whenever the ranger is commander of the scouting or screening units in an army, or its overall leader, the army treats any opposing army as if it were one row more proximate on the Results of Reconnaissance Rolls table. If the opposing army is already in the same 6-mile hex, then the army treats its degree of success as one column better instead. Any opposing army treats the ranger’s army as if it were one row less proximate for reconnaissance results, or if already at maximum distance, as if its degree of success were one column worse.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The 11th level class power for each calling is designed for use with the Domains at War rules for mass combat. The 7th level class power for the ranger calling is designed for use with the Lairs &amp; Encounters rules for wilderness exploration. If the Judge is not using these rules in his campaign, then the Nobiran champion should receive a bonus class proficiency instead of the listed class power.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>At 5th level (Guardian), a Nobiran champion’s battlefield prowess inspires others to follow him. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the champion gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the champion’s Charisma, proficiencies, or class powers.</p>
  <p>When a Nobiran champion reaches 9th level (Captain), he undertakes a study of war. The Nobiran champion gains one rank in one of the following proficiencies: Command, Military Strategy, Leadership, or Siege Engineering. Such military knowledge is quite timely, because at 9th level a champion can also found or capture a stronghold and become a protector of men. When he does so, up to 1d4+1x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 Nobiran champions of 1st-3rd level will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries.
   
  When he reaches 13th level (Captain), a Nobiran champion achieves oneness of land and lord. The Nobiran champion’s hit points are increased by 2 x the current morale score of his domain (a negative morale score will decrease his hp). Provided the champion remains Lawful, healthy, and free of <a href="Chapter05.md#corrupting-weakness">corrupting weaknesses</a>, his domain’s Land Value is increased by 2gp, as if it were benefitting from a Harvest ritual. If the champion is Neutral, but otherwise healthy and uncorrupted, there is no effect. If the champion is suffering from a curse, disease, or corrupting weakness, then his domain’s Land Value is decreased by 2gp, as if it were suffering from a Ravage ritual. This class power has no effect if the champion is not the ruler of a domain.</p>
  <p>In addition to the abilities they gain from their class, Nobiran are also born with certain gifts. The blood of ancient kings flows in Nobiran veins. All Nobirans may hire one more henchman than their Charisma would otherwise permit, and the base morale score of any henchmen is increased by 1.  Due to the favor of the gods, all Nobirans receive a +2 bonus to all saving throws. (This adjustment is already factored into the saving throws on the Nobiran Champion Saving Throws table below.) Nobirans are also ageless, enjoying a lifespan three times longer than that of normal men, free from decrepitude and weariness. Like elves, they are immune to ghoul paralysis. Finally, they enjoy divine health that renders them immune to all forms of disease, including magical diseases caused by spells, mummies, or lycanthropes.</p>
  <p>Nobiran Champion Proficiency List: Alertness, Arcane Dabbling, Beast Friendship, Blind Fighting, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery (force back, overrun, sunder), Command, Diplomacy, Endurance, Farseeing*, Fighting Style, Goblin-Slaying, Healing, Laying on Hands, Military Strategy, Passing Without Trace, Prophecy*, Running, Second Sight*, Skirmishing, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus*</p>

  <p>Gifted from birth with power beyond other men, Nobiran wizards are feared and respected by all. The blood of gods and great heroes runs in their veins, and their lives are not those of mortals. A Nobiran wizard has no need for the potions, fetishes, and ceremonies of a shaman or occultist. Even the lowliest wizard can utter a word of power to sunder the sword of his foe, or kindle flame with a gesture. The mightiest wizards can shatter the gate of a fortress with a blow from their staff, and summon up a thunder-storm with a song. Some Nobiran wizards succumb to the temptations of their great power, and are counted among the enemies of men; but most use their knowledge to advise, guide, and protect the realm from the evils that assail it.</p>
  <p>At first level, Nobiran wizards hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Like mages, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every six levels of experience. Nobiran wizards are limited to fighting with the weapons taught by their college (see below), and are unable to use shields, fight with two weapons, or wear any kind of armor.</p>
  <p>The earliest manifestation of a wizard’s gift is prestidigitation, the ability to magically accomplish simple illusions and sleight of hand tricks suitable for impressing peasants, such as lighting a candle or shaping a smoke ring, at will. To perform these effects, the wizard merely must be able to perform the task physically, and be free to speak and gesture. He may use prestidigitation to pick pockets as a thief of one half his class level.</p>
  <p>As they grow in power, Nobiran wizards are able to learn and cast eldritch spells. The number and levels of spells the wizard can use in a single day are listed on the Wizard Spell Progression table. A wizard’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his repertoire. A wizard’s repertoire can include a number of spells up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intelligence bonus. All wizards can use any magic items usable by mages or clerics.  More information on <a href="Chapter05.md#eldritch-magic">casting eldritch spells</a>, and <a href="Chapter05.md#eldritch-spell-lists">individual spell descriptions</a>, can be found in the Magic chapter.</p>
  <p>A wizard’s advancement in the magical arts is shaped by his college of wizardry. The origin of the colleges of wizardry is lost in the mists of time. However, the colleges of Artifice, Fellowship, Lore, and Nature are believed to be the oldest of the colleges. Graduates of these colleges are known for their white, grey, blue and brown robes, respectively.</p>
  <p>When a Nobiran wizard is created, select a college for the character from the College table below, and write down the proficiencies and powers of the college. Each college teaches the use of a selection of four weapons for self-defense, four proficiency selections which are added to the Wizard Proficiency List as potential class proficiency choices, and five special abilities earned as they advance in level. (Chaotic wizard may also select one of the paths of the Zaharan sorcerer, if desired.)</p>

  <h4 id="wizard-of-artifice">Wizard of Artifice</h4>
  <p>Class Proficiencies: Bargaining, Bribery, Command, Siege Engineering <br>
  Weapons: Dagger, dart, staff, whip</p>
  <p>1st level: The wizard has studied the craft of magic and the methods by which it is worked into objects. The wizard gains one rank of Magical Engineering proficiency.</p>
  <p>3rd level: The mechanisms of war are among the most intricate ever crafted by man, and worthy of deep study. The wizard gains one rank of Siege Engineering proficiency.</p>
  <p>5th level: The science of making reveals the art of unmaking. Once per day the wizard can cast dispel magic (as the 3rd level spell). The casting time is one round (10 seconds).</p>
  <p>9th level: Years of careful laboratory work begin to pay off as the wizard develops flawless precision. When conducting ordinary magic research (i.e. not using experimental methods), the wizard avoids automatic failures on unmodified die rolls of 2-3. An unmodified die roll of 1 is still an automatic failure, however.</p>
  <p>11th level: The wizard is capable of creating marvelous machines that blend science and magic. The wizard is able to design and build constructs at half the usual base time and cost.<br></p>
  <h4 id="wizard-of-fellowship">Wizard of Fellowship</h4>
  <p>Class Proficiencies: Command, Divine Blessing, Leadership, Military Strategy<br>
  Weapons: Club, dagger, dart, staff</p>
  <p>1st level: The wizard is an ever-present reminder of light and hope in a dark world. He gains the ability to inspire courage. Inspiring courage requires  a few moments of oration (one round), and grants the wizard’s allies within a 50' radius a +1 bonus to attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical fear. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). The wizard can inspire courage in any given character once per day per class level. The wizard cannot inspire courage in characters who are already engaged in combat or in characters of different alignment.</p>
  <p>3rd level: The wizard is ready to take the battle to the enemy. He gains the Martial Training proficiency, learning the use of short swords, swords, and two-handed swords.</p>
  <p>5th level: Though he may take a humble mien as he walks among the common man, a wizard in the fullness of his power is a luminous being that the dark cannot stand against. Once per day the wizard can cast inspire awe (as the 3rd level spell). The casting time is one round (10 seconds).</p>
  <p>9th level: The wizard is blessed with an aura of protection that grants a +1 bonus to AC and a +1 bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. The wizard’s aura of protection appears as a golden halo when viewed with magic.</p>
  <p>11th level: The powers of darkness cannot stand before the wizard’s bright lore. The character can turn undead as an ecclesiastic of one-half his class level. If the character casts spells that require a saving throw versus Paralysis, his targets suffer a -2 penalty on the save. When the character casts protection spells, the spell effects are calculated as if he were two class levels higher than his actual level of experience. This class power stacks with the <a href="#bright-lore-of-aura">Bright Lore of Aura</a> class proficiency.</p>
  <h4 id="wizard-of-lore">Wizard of Lore</h4>
  <p>Class Proficiencies: Mapping, Navigation, Riding, Seafaring<br>
  Weapons: Dagger, dart, sling, staff<br>
  1st level: The wizard has undertaken a careful study of ancient annals and occult mysteries. He gains the Loremastery proficiency. <br>
  3rd level: Few books and scrolls of interest to the wizard are written in the Common tongue, so the wizard must master obscure scripts, codes, and languages. He may read languages (including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings) with a proficiency throw of 5+ on 1d20. If the roll does not succeed, the wizard may not try to read that particular piece of writing until he reaches a higher level of experience.<br>
  5th level: In his studies, the wizard has learned ancient runes of power. Once per day, he can cast glyphs of warding (as the 3rd level spell). The casting time ins one round (10 seconds).<br>
  9th level: The wizard can unveil esoteric meaning hidden in mundane texts. The gp value of the wizard’s library is doubled for purposes of magical research, and he is eligible for a bonus of up to +5 (instead of +3) from library value.<br>
  11th level: By studying astrology and metaphysics, the wizard masters the lore of the stars and spheres. The wizard is able to learn and cast ritual magic at half the usual base time and cost.<br></p>
  <h4 id="wizard-of-nature">Wizard of Nature</h4>
  <p>Class Proficiencies: Animal Husbandry, Contemplation, Divine Health, Survival<br>
  Weapons: Club, dagger, sling, staff<br>
  1st level: As a friend of birds and beasts, the wizard can understand the subtle language of normal animals. He gains a +2 to all reaction rolls when encountering animals, and may take them as henchmen. He can identify flora and fauna with a proficiency throw of 11+. This class power stacks with <a href="#beast-friendship">Beast Friendship</a> proficiency.<br>
  3rd level: The ways of the wild include the art of the hunt. The wizard gains Martial Training proficiency, learning the use of short bows, short swords, and spears.<br>
  5th level: So close has the wizard grown to his wild kin that their shape is as natural to him as his own skin. Once per day, the wizard can cast skinchange (as the 3rd level spell). The casting time is one round (10 seconds).<br>
  9th level: The spirits of nature reward the wizard with an animal companion. A wizard of nature’s animal companion is mechanically identical to a shaman’s totem animal, including totem benefit (see Player’s Companion, p. 38) <br>
  11th level: Due to his attunement to nature, the wizard gains a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness. All ordinary animals within 5 miles of the wizard’s home or sanctum become kind and helpful, knowing him as a steward of the wild.</p>
  <p>When a Nobiran wizard of any college reaches 5th level (Thaumaturge), he may begin to research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions. Nobiran Wizards may collect and use divine power as clerics in order to fuel their magical research.</p>
  <p>When a wizard reaches 9th level (Wizard), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. A Nobiran wizard may also build a wizard’s tower when he reaches 9th level. He will then attract 1d6 apprentice wizards of 1st-3rd level plus 2d6 young Nobirans seeking to become wizards. Their intelligence scores will be above average, but many will become discouraged from the rigorous mental training and quit after 1d6 months. While in the wizard’s service, apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. If the wizard builds a dungeon beneath or near his tower, monsters will start to arrive to dwell within, followed shortly by adventurers seeking to fight them.</p>
  <p>At 11th level, a Nobiran wizard may learn and cast ritual spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical cross-breeds. If chaotic, a Nobiran wizard may create necromantic servants and even become undead himself, though few of their long-lived race choose to do so.</p>
  <p>The Nobiran’s ancestry offers more gifts than just spellcasting. The blood of ancient kings flows in every Nobiran. The character may hire one more henchman than his Charisma would otherwise permit, and the base morale score of any henchmen is increased by 1.  Due to the favor of the gods, all Nobirans receive a +2 bonus to all saving throws. (This adjustment is already factored into the saving throws on the Nobiran Wizard Saving Throws table below.)   They are also ageless, enjoying a lifespan three times longer than that of normal men, free from decrepitude and weariness. Like elves, they are immune to ghoul paralysis. They also enjoy divine health that renders them immune to all forms of disease, including magical diseases caused by spells, mummies, or lycanthropes.<br>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Judges may wish to allow human wizards that cast eldritch spells. Human wizards are identical to Nobiran wizards, except that they use the mage experience point progression and lose the Nobiran racial powers (don’t forget to increase the target value of all of their saving throws by 2 points).  If the Judge has Axioms Issue 1, he can also use the alternative wizard class in that book, but should replace the arcane spells with eldritch spells and the eldritch spell progression.</p>

  <p>A loremaster seeks knowledge; an occultist seeks power, and stops at nothing in this pursuit. He will make alliances with dark beings, pursue forbidden lore, and even sacrifice his own humanity for the sake of eldritch might. Many occultists become adventurers to plumb the secrets of dusty tombs, forgotten crypts, and hidden sanctums. Few do so for heroic motives. These practices leave occultists reviled and condemned in every Lawful society. More sinister societies revere and respect the occultist, and many assume positions of power in those civilizations.</p>
  <p>Occultists consider physical combat beneath them, and undergo little training in it. At first level, occultists hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws only two points every six levels of experience (i.e. the same progression as mages), though they advance in saving throws by two points every four levels (i.e. as clerics). They may only fight with daggers, darts, quarterstaffs, or whips. They are unable to use shields, fight with two weapons, or wear any kind of armor. For these reasons, occultists tend to avoid personally fighting, and many occultists prefer for their party members or minions to do the dirty work.</p>
  <p>The chief power of occultists is their ability to learn and perform eldritch ceremonies in the chthonic tradition. An occultist’s selection of ceremonies is limited to the ceremonies in his repertoire. The number and levels of ceremonies the occultist can include in his repertoire is summarized on the Occultist Ceremony Progression table, but is increased by his Intelligence bonus. An occultist can use any magic items usable by mages or clerics, , and can make trinkets to aid his performance of ceremonies. More information on ceremonial magic, and individual spell descriptions, can be found in the <a href="Chapter05.md#chapter-5-heroic-magic">Heroic Magic</a> chapter.</p>
  <p>As they advance in level, occultists may add new ceremonies to their repertoire by visiting a cult temple (see below) and spending one game week per ceremony. Particular cult temples may only offer particular ceremonies at each level, either due to the limitations of their libraries or doctrinal beliefs. Occultists who wish to learn unavailable ceremonies must find or research them on their own. The specific ceremonies taught at any given cult temple should be determined by the Judge based on his setting.</p>
  <p>As part of his training in ceremonial magic, every occultist creates a personal talisman to aid him in performing ceremonies. The  occultist’s personal talisman provides a +1 bonus to ceremony throws for ceremonies of one particular type. (The occultist may choose from death &amp; necromancy; detection; elemental air; elemental earth; elemental fire; elemental water; enchantment &amp; illusion; healing; movement; protection; summoning; and transmogrification).  When the occultist advances to 3rd level, his personal talisman can increase its bonus by +1 for ceremonies of one particular type (e.g. increase the bonus to +2 for the current type or add a bonus of +1 with a new type). When the occultist reaches 11th level, his personal talisman can increase its bonus by another +1 for ceremonies of one particular type (e.g. increase a +2 bonus to +3 for a current type, or increase a +1 bonus to +2 for a current type, or add a bonus of +1 with a new type). If desired, the occultist may increase the bonus afforded by or number of ceremony types covered by his personal talisman by  selecting the <a href="#personal-talisman">Personal Talisman proficiency</a>.</p>
  <p>The occultist also begins to unlock the secrets of the dark arts at 1st level. He may control undead as a Chaotic cleric of one half his class level (round up). If the occultist casts spells that require a saving throw versus Death, his targets suffer a -2 penalty on the save. When the occultist casts necromancy spells, the spell effects are calculated as if he were two levels higher than his actual caster level.  This class power stacks with the <a href="#black-lore-of-zahar">Black Lore of Zahar proficiency</a>.
   
  When an occultist reaches 5th level (Warlock), he may begin to research ceremonies, scribe scrolls, brew potions, and make talismans. Like clerics, occultists may collect and use divine power in order to fuel their magical research. He also learns to contact dark powers such as demons and evil spirits. These beings possess near omniscience, but contact with them can be mind-shattering. Contacting the dark powers takes 1 turn (10 minutes) and is so taxing that the occultist may only do so once per week. The effect is resolved as per the 5th level black eldritch spell contact other sphere.</p>
  <p>At 9th level (Occultist) an occultist gains the ability to create magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs as a mage. He also learns to summon infernal creatures to perform tasks for him. It takes 1 turn (10 minutes) for the summoning to be completed, during which time the warlock may take no other actions. The creature summoned might be an invisible stalker (as per the ACKS core rules), a chaos hulk, or other Chaotic creature of the Judge’s devising. The summoned creature will serve until dispel evil is cast on the creature, it is slain, or its task is fulfilled. Infernal creatures resent being summoned and may attempt to pervert their instructions if the task is protracted or dangerous. A warlock may perform a summoning but once per month.</p>
  <p>At this time he may also establish a cult temple. The occultist may buy or build his cult temple at half the normal price due to patronage from those eager to secure his occult intervention. Once a cult temple is established, the occultist’s reputation will spread and he will attract 5d6x10 0th level soldiers armed with various weapons, plus another 1d6 occultists of 1st-3rd level of the same tradition to serve his cult. The occultist’s followers are completely loyal (morale +4), and need not be paid wages. Occultists’ cult temples are otherwise identical to cleric’s fortified temples, as detailed in the Campaign chapter of the ACKS Rulebook.</p>
  <p>At 11th level, an occultist may cast ritual arcane spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, create magical cross-breeds, create necromantic servants, and become undead. Of those few occultists who reach this level of power, many sacrifice body and soul in pursuit of power and become undead.

  <p>Runemakers are warriors skilled in the lore of runes, magic sigils that contain eldritch power. Though unable to cast spells in the manner of a mage or wizard, runemakers can accomplish many of the same feats through their runes. Through rune-lore, runemakers can see the future, curse their enemies, and perform other miraculous deeds.</p>
  <p>Runemakers are skilled combatants, albeit not as good as fighters. At first level, runemakers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience (a progression mid-way between fighters and mages). Because runemakers lack the broad professional training of the fighter, they may only wear chain mail or lighter armor, and are limited to fighting with the traditional weapons of their homeland.</p>
  <p>When a runemaker is created, select a region of origin for the character from the Regional Origin table below, and note down the permitted weapons, bonus proficiency, and fighting styles. The regions below are identical to those presented for the barbarian class in the Player’s Companion. The Judge may create other regions of origin for runemakers within his own campaign setting where necessary.</p>

  <p>Those who study runes known that gods and men alike are ruled by fate. At 1st level (Runelearner), a runemaker can cast the runes to receive an augury (as the spell) about what fate has in store. It takes one round to cast the runes. A runemaker must have access to his <a href="#traditional-implements">runic implements</a> in order to cast the runes, and he can do so only once every 8 hours. (Note that “casting” in this context is analogous to the casting of dice, not the casting of spells).</p>
  <p>Starting at 2nd level (Runecarver), a runemaker begins to learn and perform eldritch ceremonies in the runic tradition. The runemaker’s selection of ceremonies is limited to the ceremonies in his repertoire. The number and levels of ceremonies the runemaker can include in his repertoire is shown on the Runemaker Ceremony Progression table, but is increased by his Intelligence bonus. Runemakers can use any magic items usable by mages or clerics. More information on ceremonial magic, and individual spell descriptions, can be found in the <a href="Chapter05.md#chapter-5-heroic-magic">Heroic Magic</a> chapter.</p>
  <p>At 3rd level (Runegiver), a runemaker can curse an enemy with ill fate once per day, by either chanting the curse or activating a curse-pole. Chanting a curse takes one round (10 seconds) and must be done when the target is nearby (within 30’) and in earshot. In combat, chanting a curse must be declared before initiative is rolled, and it fails if the runemaker’s concentration is interrupted before the process is completed (as with casting a spell). Chanting a curse can be a dangerous practice, since most targets take unkindly to being cursed!</p>
  <p>As a safer alternative, the runemaker can activate a curse-pole. A curse-pole is an 8’-10’ wooden staff carved with the target’s name and topped with an animal’s severed head or skull. Assuming materials are at hand, it takes 1 hour to carve a curse-pole, 1 turn (10 minutes) to raise it, and finally 1 round (10 seconds) to activate it. The runemaker can be freely interrupted while carving or raising the curse-pole without this affecting the success or failure of his efforts, but if he is interrupted while activating the curse-pole, the curse fails and the whole process must be begun again. A curse-pole can be carved anywhere, but it must be raised and activated within sight of the entrance to the target’s home. A curse-pole cannot be moved once raised, but it can be camouflaged or hidden with magic once placed.</p>
  <p>Once the curse is chanted or curse-pole is activated, the target must make a saving throw versus Spells. If the target fails the saving throw, he is cursed and immediately begins to suffer the runemaker’s choice of one of the following three ill fates:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>-4 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1)</li>
  <li>-4 penalty on attack and saving throws</li>
  <li>Prime requisite halved (minimum 1)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A curse cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a remove curse spell. A curse caused by a curse-staff can also be removed if the curse-staff is moved or broken. A runemaker can have only one curse in effect at a time; if he curses an enemy while a prior curse is still in effect, the prior curse is immediately removed. Calling down a curse is considered grey magic for purposes of <a href="Chapter05.md#corruption">corruption</a>.</p>
  <p>When a runemaker reaches 5th level (Runecrafter), he may begin to research ceremonies, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. Runemakers may collect and use divine power as clerics in order to fuel their magical research. Also at 5th level, the runemaker’s widespread renown inspires his hirelings to strive for glory themselves. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the runemaker gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the runemaker’s Charisma or proficiencies.</p>
  <p>At 9th level (Runelord), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. A runemaker may also build or claim a chieftain’s hall when he reaches 9th level. When the runemaker establishes his hall, 1d4+1x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 runemakers of 1st-3rd level seeking the secrets of the runes will join his service. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. Runemakers’ halls are otherwise identical to fighters’ castles, as detailed in the Campaign chapter of the ACKS rulebook.</p>
  <p>At 11th level (Runelord), a runemaker may, learn and cast ritual spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical cross-breeds. If chaotic, the runemaker may create necromantic servants and become undead.</p>
  <p>Any time after reaching 11th level, the runemaker can choose to learn the wisdom of the ages. Learning the wisdom of the ages, however, requires a terrible sacrifice – the runemaker must either pluck out his own eye, chop off his own hand, slice off his own ears, or cut off his own nose. The injury must be self-inflicted, and if it is ever healed (through magic) the runemaker loses the wisdom of the ages irrevocably. A runemaker who learns the wisdom of the ages gains insight into secrets of the past, the present, and the future that are hidden from all except the gods. In game terms, the runemaker may cast commune once per week (note that commune is a ritual-level spell in Heroic Fantasy Handbook campaigns).

  <p>Of the Thrassian race, whose shadow once made bleak the whole of ancient Ammas Aurë, few of its number were more feared than the deathchanters. These black-tongued lieutenants of the Thrassian host called to their kin with the voice of the Chthonic gods, goading and frenzying their brethren into executing the most heinous and merciless acts against those who would defy their scaled empire. Even after the dimming of the Thrassian star and their decent into barbarism and ignorance, Zaharan sorcerers of skill and power, in order to feed their own appetite for glorious infamy, still sought to breed Thrassians of pure enough stock to keep the death-songs of that race from passing into an impotent silence. Today, Thrassian death chants can rarely be heard in grim Kemesh and other remote corners of the world, and woe to those numbered amongst the enemies of an awakened Thrassian deathchanter who still recalls the scaled chants of shadow and death.  While their individual power remains formidable, deathchanters also serve as caretakers and spirit guides to the warriors and champions hatched among them. They seek to remain a conduit to the utter dark, lifting their race to even higher plateaus of havoc and slaughter. As these creatures slowly gain power, they become a scaly bulwark upon which their allies lean and their enemies break.</p>
  <p>All deathchanters are noble Thrassians – powerful creatures bearing the eldritch blessing of the Chthonic host. They stand 7’ to 8’ tall, with large reptilian heads, lizard-like tails, and scaly, muscular frames. They have a halting, almost serpentine gait that limits them to movement rate of 60’, but can swim with a movement rate of 120’ and can hold their breath for up to 1 turn. Their dragon-like wings grant a flying movement rate of 30’, but they can fly for only 60 rounds (1 turn) before becoming fatigued. Their glowing yellow eyes grant them infravision out to 120’, and their long claws, razor sharp teeth and powerful, protruding fangs are dreadful weapons (see below). Their frightening visage and reptilian coldness, combined with the wretched reputation of the Thrassian race, cause a Thrassian deathchanter to suffer a -4 penalty to reactions, loyalty, and morale when dealing with humans and demi-humans. However, such characters gain a +4 bonus to reactions, loyalty, and morale of any lizardmen the deathchanter encounters.</p>
  <p>Thrassian deathchanters are dangerous combatants, even without magic. At first level, they hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. A deathchanter’s scaly hide gives them a base unarmored AC of 5, and they may supplement this protection with up to chain mail armor.  They may wield swords, daggers, spears, and polearms, as well as any missile weapon, and may fight with two weapons, weapons and shields, and two-handed weapons. They increase their base damage roll from missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, and 9th level. In lieu of using weapons, deathchanters may attack with two claws and a dagger-sharp bite in a round, dealing 1d4-1 points of damage per claw and 1d10-1 points of damage with their bite. A deathchanter’s claws and bite are modified by their STR adjustment and class damage bonus.</p>
  <p>At 1st level (Listener), a deathchanter takes his first step into the deep black of the Chthonic embrace. They learn the proper performance (chant) of the ritual death songs, common and obscure, that are the foundations of Thrassian supremacy. Additionally, at 1st level the deathchanter learns to rouse allies to fury. Rouse to fury requires a few moments of chanting before a battle (1 round), and grants the deathchanter’s allies within a 50’ radius a +1 bonus to attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the Thrassian), and saving throws against magical fear. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). The Thrassian deathchanter can rouse to fury once per day per class level, but cannot inflame the minds of allies already engaged in combat.</p>
  <p>Deathchanters are infamous for their chthonic chants of life and death.  Beginning at 2nd level (Talon of Scales), a deathchanter’s chant becomes infused with eldritch power and song, granting them the art of spellsinging. A deathchanter performs magic by spending spell points (SP) rather than by expending daily spell castings. Each spell costs a number of spell points to sing. The higher the level of the spell, the more points it costs. The Spell Point Costs table describes each spell’s cost. The deathchanter’s use of spell points gives them the flexibility to choose to cast a large number of lower level spells, a small number of higher level spells, or any combination in between. See the Heroic Magic chapter for details on <a href="Chapter05.md#spellsinging">spellsinging</a>.
   
  Most deathchanters cannot resist the call of the wicked darkness that whispers to the souls of all Thrassians, and as a result the overwhelming majority of deathchanters bear the hideous scars and unsettling signs of depravity that mark all those who embrace the most tenebrous chants of black magic. (See <a href="Chapter05.md#the-shades-of-magic">Shades of Magic</a>) There are a miniscule few, however, who walk the narrower paths of grey or even white magic in their pursuit to voice the Thrassian chants of making and unmaking.</p>
  <p>Thrassian deathchanters recover their spell points in the same way spellcasters recover their daily spell castings, by spending eight hours resting without interruption and one hour concentrating on prayer or study. Spell points can only be recovered by resting once every 24 hours. Deathchanters can also tap ambient magic to fuel their spells without expending their own SPs. See <a href="Chapter05.md#tapping-power">Tapping Power</a> of the Heroic Magic chapter for details on tapping ambient magic.</p>
  <p>Like other eldritch casters, a deathchanter’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his repertoire. A deathchanter’s repertoire can include a number of spells up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intelligence bonus, and functions exactly like an arcane/eldritch caster’s repertoire in all respects. Unlike other casters, however, deathchanters can cast spells that are not in their repertoire by extemporaneously singing spells. See the Heroic Magic chapter for details on <a href="Chapter05.md#extemporaneous-spellsinging">extemporaneous spellsinging</a>.</p>
  <p>When a Thrassian deathchanter reaches 5th level (High Chanter), his battlefield prowess begins to inspire others to follow him. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the deathchanter gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with the modifiers from the Thrassian deathchanter’s Charisma, proficiencies, and race.</p>
  <p>If they remain living creatures, Thrassian deathchanters can only advance to 8th level. However, like Zaharans, they may grow in power after the flesh. If transformed into intelligent undead, they retain their racial powers and any class abilities. Once transformed, a 1 HD undead Thrassian requires 4,850 XP to advance to 2 HD, and the amount of XP required to advance as an undead doubles with each HD thereafter (round values greater than 20,000 XP to the nearest 1,000). All of the deathchanter’s class abilities will continue to progress without regard to his class’s maximum level, to a maximum of 14th level. The deathchanter may continue to advance in Hit Dice without limit, even past his class’s maximum level.</p>
  <p>Should he become undead and advance to 9th level (Deathchanter Lord), a Thrassian deathchanter can build a fortress-chantry to praise the Chthonic host and the Thrassian race. When he does so, up to 1d4+1x5 lizardmen mercenaries and 1d6 Thrassian deathchanters of 1st-3rd level will come to add their voices to the chant. If the lizardmen are hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. Through force of arms and dark blessing, the Thrassian deathchanter may ultimately control several fortresses or even entire realms, though he can expect to face ongoing challenges to his rule from humans and demi-humans. Additional rules for castles are detailed in the ACKS Core Rulebook as well as Domains of War.</p>
  <p>Finally, should a Thrassian deathchanter reach 9th level (Deathchanter), he may begin to research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions, as if he were a 5th level eldritch caster.</p>

  <p>Commerce is the great wheel upon which the world turns. From the fleshy fingers of slave traders to jewel-clad guild masters, the coin and commodities of the empire are controlled by merchants. But if the stereotypical merchant is a pot-bellied financier profiting from the work of others, the venturer is his opposite: An adventurous world traveler, he personally leads caravans into unknown lands, seeking out exotic goods and new markets. Every venturer is, by definition, an adventurer, and interested in any expedition that promises riches and reward.</p>
  <p>Venturers are trained combatants, although not as skilled as fighters. At first level, venturers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience (i.e. the same as thieves). They may use any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons. They can fight with a shield or with a weapon in each hand, but cannot fight two-handed. Venturers prefer to stay mobile and cannot wear armor heavier than chainmail.</p>
  <p>The business of venturers is business, and their devotion to trade and profit yields them many special abilities. Foremost among these is the mercantile network of contacts, fences, and peddlers that venturers build through their travels. Whenever venturers buy and sell equipment, hire retainers, and engage in mercantile ventures in a market they have previously visited, they treat the market as if it were one market class larger than its actual size. (Class I markets remain Class I markets.)</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>EXAMPLE: Cain, a 5th level venturer, is in Cyfaraun (a Class IV market). He wishes to purchase a heavy warhorse (700gp). According to the Equipment Availability by Market Class table, there is only a 25% chance for 1 heavy warhorse to be available in a Class IV market. However, Cain has visited Cyfaraun before, so he may treat it as a Class III market. There is a 100% chance for 1 heavy warhorse available in a Class III market, so Cain is able to purchase the heavy warhorse. His party members shake their heads in amazement that he’s found such a fine steed in an outpost town. “I know people,” he explains.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Venturers are expert bargainers who get the best deals available for goods, services, and information. Any items the venturer purchases cost 10% less than the listed price and any items he sells go for 10% more than the listed price (as per the Bargaining proficiency). If trading with another venturer, or a character with the Bargaining proficiency, the opposed bargainers should make reaction rolls. Whichever character scores the higher result gets the discount. A venturer may select Bargaining proficiency to improve his skills. Each time the proficiency is selected, the character receives a +2 bonus on his reaction roll when negotiating with other bargainers.</p>
  <p>Venturers know that business empires can rise and fall on information, so they learn to keep their ears open at all times. All venturers can hear noises as thieves of their level.</p>
  <p>They likewise become conversant in the tongues of their trading partners. Venturers begin play with four bonus languages selected from among those in common use in the campaign setting (Judge’s discretion).  Venturers are also experts in reading languages. On a proficiency throw of 5+ on 1d20, the venturer can decipher a document (including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings). If the roll does not succeed, the venturer may not try to read that particular piece of writing until he reaches a higher level of experience.</p>
  <p>While most merchants consider risk a financial term, venturers lead their own caravans or fleets, and do so with considerable skill. As expert travelers, venturers begin play with Riding or Seafaring proficiency (their choice). Any time the venturer’s party is in terrain familiar to the venturer, they get a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to avoid getting lost.</p>
  <p>In order to open new markets and establish trade with unknown tribes, venturers study diplomacy. They receive a +2 bonus on all reaction rolls when they attempt to parley with intelligent creatures (as per the Diplomacy proficiency). Of course, not every market obeys the rule of law, so venturers also become exceptionally skilled at the art of bribery. Offering a bribe permits an additional reaction roll during encounters, with the throw modified by the size of the bribe. As a general rule, a bribe equal to one day’s pay for the target provides a +1 bonus, a week’s pay provides a +2 bonus, and a month’s pay provides a +3 bonus. Only one bribe can be attempted per target in any given situation.</p>
  <p>When a venturer attains 9th level (Merchant Prince), he can establish a guildhouse, and 2d6 venturer apprentices of 1st level will offer to work for him. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for ruffians. Many venturers use these followers to start a syndicate, expanding their wealth through legitimate and illegitimate channels. Except as noted, a venturer’s guildhouse follows the rules for hideouts detailed in the Hideouts &amp; Hijinks section of Chapter 7 of ACKS.</p>
  <p>Venturer Proficiency List: Alertness, Ambushing, Arcane Dabbling*, Bargaining, Climbing, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery (disarm, incapacitate), Command, Gambling, Intimidation, Language, Leadership, Lip Reading, Magical Engineering, Mapping, Mountaineering, Navigation, Passing Without Trace, Precise Shooting, Profession, Riding, Running, Seafaring, Signaling, Skirmishing, Swashbuckling, Weapon Finesse</p>

  <p>Some heroes embody mythic archetypes.  One such archetype is the coupling of love and war: sometimes the violent god of war and the mercurial goddess of love are united as paramours; other times, love and war are symbolically united as one mercurial and violent being, a goddess of love and war; but in every case, violence and sensuality, lust and bloodlust, are intertwined. The warmistress is the living embodiment of such myths, a swordswoman blessed by divine powers who lives, loves, bleeds, and dies with fury and passion. In the Auran Empire campaign setting, warmistresses might be favored daughters of Ianna, goddess of love and war, or mortal descendants of Bel the Slaughterprince and Nasga the seducer. Whatever their deity, virtually all warmistresses are adventurers, mercenaries, and sellswords, wandering red-handed through the world, leaving in their wake the broken hearts of their lovers and the bloodied corpses of their enemies.</p>
  <p>Warmistresses are highly gifted combatants. At first level, warmistresses hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. Warmistresses are trained to fight with dagger, short sword, sword, spear, and whip, as well as with all missile weapons. They may fight with a weapon in each hand or with one two handed weapon, but do not fight with shields.</p>
  <p>All warmistresses are blessed with a charismatic ferocity. When attacking with one-handed melee weapons or thrown weapons, a warmistress may apply her CHA modifier instead of her STR modifier on her damage rolls. This damage bonus is increased by an additional +1 at 1st level and another +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level.</p>
  <p>Warmistresses fight with lissome speed and grace. Due to her weapon finesse, a warmistress may apply her DEX modifier instead of her STR modifier on her attack throw with one-handed melee weapons. Warmistresses are renowned for wearing little to no protection, and never wear armor heavier than leather. Due to her graceful fighting, however, a warmistress gains a +1 bonus to initiative rolls  and a +1 bonus to Armor Class if able to move freely. At 7th level, the AC bonus increases to +2, and at 13th level the AC bonus increases to +3.  This bonus stacks with Swashbuckling proficiency.</p>
  <p>By the grace of the goddess of love, warmistresses possess alluring beauty. A warmistress gains a +2 bonus on reaction rolls with NPCs who are potentially attracted to her. If this bonus results in a total of 12 or more, the subjects act as if charmed while in her presence. Creatures with a WIS greater than the warmistress’s CHA are immune to this power (and the warmistress will know they are immune). This bonus stacks with Mystic Aura and/or Seduction proficiency.</p>
  <p>Through teasing, taunting, and flirting, a warmistress can use her alluring beauty to provoke the passions of an intelligent creature that is potentially attracted to her. Provoking the passions of a creature requires one round (10 seconds), during which time the warmistress must remain stationary and take no other action. A creature must be within 30’ of the warmistress and able to both see and hear her in order to be the target of provocation. The targeted creature must make a saving throw versus Spells. The Judge may grant bonuses or penalties to the saving throw depending on circumstances, the temperament of the creature, and its training or familiarity with the warmistress. If the save succeeds, the creature is not provoked. If the save fails, the creature is provoked for 1d4 rounds plus 1 round per level of the warmistress.</p>
  <p>The effect of provocation depends on the creature’s current reaction to the warmistress (see ACKS, p. 99). A hostile creature will become enraged, attacking the warmistress in preference to all others without regard for its own safety for the duration of the provocation. An unfriendly creature will become hostile, seeking to verbally or physically harass the warmistress for the duration. A neutral creature will become distracted, ignoring other duties or activities to pay attention to the warmistress for the duration. An indifferent creature will become friendly, seeking to assist the warmistress for the duration. A friendly creature will become enamored, helping the warmistress as if charmed for the duration of the provocation. If the warmistress or one of her allies attacks a creature while it is provoked, it immediately becomes enraged.</p>
  <p>Starting at 3rd level (Sister of the Sword), a warmistress can perform a death-dealing dance. Beginning a death-dealing dance takes no time itself, so the warmistress can move and/or attack on the same initiative she begins the dance. Once begun, a death-dealing dance continues until either all visible enemies are slain, the warmistress is incapacitated, the warmistress chooses to end the dance, or 1 turn (10 minutes) elapses, whichever comes first. While performing a death-dealing dance, a warmistress is a whirlwind of flashing blades and swirling garb, gaining one bonus melee or thrown attack each round and dealing 1d6 bonus points of damage with every successful melee or thrown attack (including cleaves). A 3rd level warmistress can perform a death-dealing dance just once per day, but a 7th level warmistress can perform a death-dealing dance twice per day, and an 11th level warmistress can perform a death-dealing dance three times per day.</p>
  <p>When a warmistress reaches 5th level (Maiden of War), her fiery spirit inspires those around her to do great deeds. Any henchmen and mercenaries attracted to the warmistress gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever she is present. This bonus stacks with any other modifiers from the warmistress’s Charisma or proficiencies.</p>
  <p>At 9th level (Lady of War), a warmistress can build or conquer a stronghold and establish herself as the ruler of a domain. (Rules for strongholds and domains are detailed in the Campaign chapter of ACKS. ) When she does so, she will attract 1d4+1x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 fighters, explorers, or warmistresses of 1st-3rd level to her service. Worshipping the warmistress as if she were a living goddess, these zealous followers are completely loyal (morale +4) and need not be paid wages, though they must still be provided food and lodging.
   
  A warmistress of 13th level (Lady of War) has become an unconquerable soul. She gains a +1 bonus to all saving throws. (These bonuses are already factored into the saving throws on the Warmistress Attack and Saving Throws table below.) If reduced to 0 hp or less, she may choose to remain conscious and fight on, doing so for up to four rounds. If she fights on for one round, she suffers a -2 penalty on her eventual roll on the Mortal Wounds table. If she fights on for two rounds, the penalty is increased to -5. If she fights on for three rounds, the penalty is increased to -10. If she fights on for four rounds, she dies at the end of the her initiative.</p>

  <p>From time to time, a Zaharan arises whose cruelty, ruthlessness, and lust for power are remarkable even for one of their dark race. Such a being is called a darklord, and he brings doom and woe to all who cross him. If left unchecked by Lawful heroes, a rising darklord will inevitably unite the vile minions of Chaos and usher in an era of war, ruin, and darkness.</p>
  <p>Though they prefer to allow minions to fight for them, darklords are nevertheless formidable combatants. At first level, darklords hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Thereafter they advance in attack and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience (i.e., the same as clerics). Darklords can fight with battle axes, crossbows, great axes, maces, morning stars, and swords, often decorating their weapons with vile runes, bloody spikes, serrated edges, and other sinister decorations.</p>
  <p>Darklords can wear any armor up to and including plate (and can cast spells while so armored), and can fight with a weapon in each hand or with a two-handed weapon, but cannot use shields.</p>
  <p>Like the Zaharan sorcerer, the darklord possesses the ability to learn and cast eldritch spells. The number and levels of spells the darklord can use in a single day are listed on the Darklord Spell Progression table. A darklord’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his repertoire. A darklord’s repertoire can include a number of spells up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intelligence bonus. All darklords can use any magic items usable by mages or clerics.  More information on casting eldritch spells, and individual spell descriptions, can be found in the <a href="Chapter05.md#chapter-5-heroic-magic">Heroic Magic</a> chapter.</p>
  <p>However, the paramount power of the darklord is his ability to dominate beastmen. By calling upon his implacable will and magical strength, the darklord can command the vile minions of Chaos to do his bidding. The darklord must be visible to the beastmen and be able to speak a language they understand in order to dominate them. The potency of this ability is determined by level.</p>
  <p>On the Dominate Beastmen table, there will be a dash, an “A”, an “X”, or a number corresponding to the Hit Dice of the beastman and the level of the darklord. A dash means that the darklord has not attained a high enough level to dominate beastmen of that HD. A number indicates that the player must roll that number or higher on 1d20 in order to dominate the beastmen. If the beastmen are already friendly to the darklord, he gains a +2 bonus to the throw. If the throw succeeds, the darklord dominates 2d6 total Hit Dice of beastmen for 1 turn per level of experience. An “A” (“automatic”) means that the darklord automatically dominates 2d6 total Hit Dice of beastmen for 1 turn per level. An “X” (“extended”) means that the darklord automatically dominates 2d6 total Hit Dice of beastmen for 1 day per level. At least one beastman will always be dominated, as appropriate, on a successful domination throw. If beastmen of mixed HD are present when the darklord attempts to dominate them, the weakest beastmen will be dominated first.  When the darklord’s domination ends, the beastmen will flee from his presence for 10 rounds, following the best and fastest means available to them. If they cannot flee, they cower in terror, taking no actions and suffering a -2 penalty to AC.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>EXAMPLE: Theophanous, a 5th level darklord, confronts a gang of five orcs (1 HD) accompanied by an orc champion (1+1 HD) from the Blood Eye tribe, accompanied by an ogre (4+1 HD).  On his initiative, he attempts to dominate the beastmen. He automatically can dominate 1 HD orcs, but he needs to throw 4+ to dominate the orc champion and 13+ to dominate the ogre. He throws 1d20 and the result is 14. Therefore he has (potentially) dominated all the beastmen. Had he rolled, e.g., an 13 he would only have dominated the orcs and orc champion, and had he rolled a 3 or less he’d only have dominated the orcs.<br><br>
  He now rolls 2d6 to determine the number of Hit Dice he has dominated and rolls a 7. Since the weakest beastmen must be dominated first, he dominates the five orcs and the orc champion (6.25 HD total) but not the ogre. Had he rolled an 11, he could have dominated the 4+1 HD ogre as well (10.5 HD total). In any case, the beastmen will remain under his domination for 1 turn per level, or 5 turns.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>There is no limit to how often an darklord may attempt to command beastmen each day, but if an attempt to command beastmen ever fails during an encounter, the darklord may not attempt to command beastmen again for the remainder of that encounter. There is no limit to the number of beastmen that may be under a darklord’s command at once.</p>
  <p>Dominated beastmen behave as if charmed and need not be paid to maintain their service. However, they still must make loyalty rolls when suffering a calamity (see D@W: Campaigns, p. 11), such as routing from a battle, suffering 25% or greater casualties, or being out of supply. The darklord’s morale modifier is applied to any loyalty rolls. If a loyalty roll fails with a modified roll of 2-, the beastmen break free of the darklord’s domination. On a 3-5, the beastmen’s morale is reduced by 1 point but they remain dominated. On any other result, the beastmen remain dominated.</p>
  <p>Dominated beastmen will adventure with or for the darklord and serve as troops under his or his henchmen’s command on the battlefield. When dominated beastmen adventure with the darklord, the darklord’s morale modifier is applied to their morale rolls. When dominated beastmen are serving as troops on the battlefield, the darklord’s morale modifier is applied to their shock and morale rolls if he is commanding or attached to their unit. Otherwise, ½ the darklord’s morale modifier is applied to their morale rolls only, while their unit commander’s morale modifier is applied to morale and shock rolls. See D@W: Battles, p. 23, 25-26. Failed morale and shock rolls do not break domination, so any surviving beastmen can be rallied back to the darklord’s service after the battle.</p>
  <p>It is possible for a darklord to lose control of his beastmen to rivals. A champion, sub-chieftain, or chieftain of a beastman tribe can attempt to break the darklord’s hold over fellow members of his tribe through his own force of personality. Such attempts are resolved with a domination throw, treating the beastman NPC’s HD as the Darklord’s level on the Dominate Beastmen table  and the darklord’s level as the Beastman HD. Success breaks the darklord’s hold over 2d6 HD worth of dominated beastmen. (Wise darklords avoid this problem by ensuring that all of the chiefs and champions of the beastman tribe are also under his domination!) A rival darklord can attempt to dominate another darklord’s beastmen by using his own level opposed by the rival darklord’s level. Success transfers control of 2d6 HD worth of dominated beastmen over to the new darklord.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>EXAMPLE: Theophanous finds himself face-to-face with Tamraz, the 4 HD chieftain of the Blood Eye orcs. Tamraz attempts to break the darklord’s hold over his beastmen. Consulting the Dominate Beastmen table, the Judge sees that the 4 HD chieftain will need to roll 16+ on his dominate throw to break the 5th-level darklord’s domination. The Judge rolls an 18! The chieftain frees 2d6 HD worth of beastmen from Theophanous’s vile grip. Unfortunately, the result of the 2d6 roll is a 3, so only 3 orcs are freed from domination.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>A darklord does not gain any special ability to communicate with his dominated beastmen except that which he already possesses (i.e. they are not under his telepathic control). Darklords with large numbers of dominated beastmen usually rely on trust henchmen and vassals to oversee them.</p>
  <p>When a darklord reaches 2nd level (Evildoer), he gains the ability to inspire dread in his foes. Inspiring dread requires  a few moments of oration (one round), and gives the darklord’s opponents within a 50' radius a -1 penalty to attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls, and saving throws against magical fear. The penalty lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). The darklord can only attempt to inspire dread once per day per class level. Opponents may save versus Spells to resist the effect. When used on the battlefield this ability can affect one enemy unit in an adjacent hex.</p>
  <p>At 4th level (Villain), a darklord gains the ability to instill his strength into his minions. Instilling strength requires a few moments of oration (one round), and grants dominated beastmen within 30’ a pool of temporary hit points equal to the lower of the darklord’s or the beastmen’s base healing rate. These temporary hit points last for one turn (10 minutes) or until lost to damage, whichever comes first. The darklord can instill strength once per day per level.  (When used on the battlefield this ability can affect one friendly unit in the darklord’s hex.)</p>
  <p>When a darklord reaches 5th level (Malefactor), he may begin to research spells, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. Darklords may collect and use divine power as clerics in order to fuel their magical research.</p>
  <p>At 6th level (Dread Leader), the darklord’s malevolent reputation makes it easier to recruit large hosts of minions. Whenever the darklord succeeds in dominating beastmen with an “A” result, 3d6 Hit Dice worth of beastmen are dominated. With an “X” result, 4d6 Hit Dice worth of beastmen are dominated.</p>
  <p>When a darklord reaches 8th level (Black Captain), his implacable will extends the duration of his domination. Whenever the character succeeds in dominating beastmen (whether from a roll or automatically from an “A” result), the beastmen are dominated for 1 day per level  instead of the usual 1 turn per level. If the beastmen would have been dominated for 1 day per level (from an “X” result), the beastmen are instead controlled indefinitely.</p>
  <p>At 9th level (Dark Lord), a darklord is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. A darklord may also establish a dark tower, usually in a remote and desolate location, when he reaches 9th level. He will then attract 1d6 Zaharans of various classes of 1st-3rd level. While in the darklord’s service, Zaharan followers must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. If the darklord builds a dungeon beneath or near his sanctum, monsters will start to arrive to dwell within, followed shortly by adventurers seeking to fight them. A darklord’s stronghold will always be a chaotic domain (see ACKS p. 134 or Axioms 2, p. 5).</p>
  <p>When a darklord reaches 10th (Dark Lord), begins to gather together the darkness. if he has established a chaotic domain, then each month, his domain gains an extra 1d10 beastman families for every 1,000 beastmen in his realm, until its maximum population density is achieved. If he has established a chaotic realm, every chaotic domain in his realm gains additional beastmen at the same rate as well.</p>
  <p>At 11th level (Dark Lord), a darklord may learn and cast ritual arcane spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical cross-breeds. If chaotic, the darklord may create necromantic servants and become undead himself, typically becoming a deathbound wraith, draugr, mummy lord, or vampire. Becoming undead enables the darklord to continue advancing in level (see After the Flesh, below).</p>
  <p>If a darklord embraces undeath and advances to 12th level (Dark Lord), he gains the ability to exert his dread shadow across vast distances. The darklord can now inspire dread in any enemy unit which he can specifically identify (e.g. “the Golden Company of The Syrnasos” or “the cataphract squadron of Legate Valerian”) regardless of range. The darklord can likewise instill strength into any unit of dominated beastman under his control at any distance. The darklord is still limited in using these abilities no more than once per day per level.</p>
  <p>All Zaharan darklords possess certain inhuman benefits and drawbacks from their demoniac bloodline. First, Zaharan darklords are inexorable in the face of horrors that terrify normal men. They are immune to all natural and magical fear effects.</p>
  <p>Second, darklords benefit from the ancient pacts of service and obedience by which the lords of Zahar ensorcelled the dark powers of the world. Some creatures still remember these pacts and will aid Zaharans when commanded. All Zaharan darklords gain a +2 bonus to reaction rolls when encountering intelligent chaotic monsters. Intelligent chaotic monsters suffer a -2 penalty to saving throws against any charm spells cast by a Zaharan darklord.</p>
  <p>Third, due to their background and training, all Zaharan darklords speak four dark tongues. In the Auran Empire campaign setting, these languages are Ancient Zaharan, Goblin, Orc, and Kemeshi. The Judge should substitute appropriate languages of his own devising for other campaigns.</p>
  <p>Finally, Zaharan darklords grow in power after the flesh. If transformed into intelligent undead, they retain their racial powers and any class abilities. Once transformed, a 1 HD undead darklord requires 4,500 XP to advance to 2 HD, and the amount of XP required to advance as an undead doubles with each HD thereafter (round values greater than 20,000 XP to the nearest 1,000). All of the darklord’s class abilities will continue to progress without regard to his class’s maximum level, to a maximum of 14th level. The darklord may continue to advance in Hit Dice without limit, even past his class’s maximum level.</p>
  <p>However, because of their dark souls, the grim embrace of death holds special perils for Zaharans. Whenever a deceased Zaharan rolls on the Tampering with Mortality table, he suffers a penalty on the 1d20 roll of -1 per level of experience.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Zaharans are an ancient race of evil men from the Auran Empire campaign setting. Outside of the Auran Empire campaign setting, Zaharans could be used to model any dark, eldritch race, such as the Melnibonéans of Moorcock’s Multiverse; the Black Numenoreans of Tolkien’s Middle Earth; the Acheronians of Howard’s Hyboria; or the Drow of Gygax’s Greyhawk. In settings where normal men cannot become spellcasters, Zaharans represent those mortals who are capable of working black magic from dark pacts or demonic ancestry.</p>

  <p>The Zaharan sorcerer is the scion of black magicians and necromancers of an earlier age. The dreadful pacts and foul bargains struck by his ancestors bring the Zaharan sorcerer preternatural power and certain damnation. If an occultist is one who chooses to walk the path of darkness, then the Zaharan sorcerer is one born to travel it. Common men prefer to believe that Zaharan sorcerers do not exist; occultists know they exist, and hold them in fear and envy.</p>
  <p>Zaharan sorcerers consider physical combat beneath them, and undergo little training in it. At first level, sorcerers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws only two points every six levels of experience (i.e., the same as mages), though they advance in saving throws by two points every four levels (i.e. as clerics). Zaharan sorcerers are limited to fighting with the weapons taught by their path (see below), and are unable to use shields, fight with two weapons, or wear any kind of armor.</p>
  <p>The most formidable power of the sorcerer is his ability to learn and cast eldritch spells. The number and levels of spells the sorcerer can use in a single day are listed on the Sorcerer Spell Progression table. A sorcerer’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his repertoire. A sorcerer’s repertoire can include a number of spells up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intelligence bonus. All sorcerers can use any magic items usable by mages or clerics.  More information on casting eldritch spells, and individual spell descriptions, can be found in the <a href="Chapter05.md#chapter-5-heroic-magic">Heroic Magic</a> chapter.</p>
  <p>As many of the secrets of black magic are found in occultist’s codices, every sorcerer is also capable of performing ceremonies in the chthonic tradition. The sorcerer does not have two separate repertoires - his repertoire of spells doubles as his repertoire of ceremonies. He can add ceremonies found in chthonic codices to his spellbook with one week of study. See the rules for <a href="Chapter05.md#ceremonial-magic">Ceremonial Magic</a> for more details.</p>
  <p>A sorcerer’s advancement in the magical arts is shaped by his path of sorcery. There are many dark and unspeakable paths a sorcerer may follow, but the most common are Dominion, Necromancy, Summoning, and Transmogrification.</p>

  <p>When a Zaharan sorcerer is created, select a path for the character from the Path table below, and write down the proficiencies and powers of the path. Each path teaches the use of a selection of four weapons, four proficiency selections which are added to the Sorcerer Proficiency List as potential class proficiency choices, and five special abilities earned as they advance in level. (Soft-hearted Zaharan sorcerers who fear to walk the dark path can also select one of the colleges of the Nobiran wizard, if desired.)</p>
  <h4 id="sorcerer-of-dominion">Sorcerer of Dominion</h4>
  <p>Class Proficiencies: Command, Intimidation, Leadership, Military Strategy<br>
  Weapons: Club, dagger, staff, whip</p>
  <p>1st level:  With grim threats of woe and doom, the dominator can inspire dread in his foes. Inspiring dread requires  a few moments of oration (one round), and gives the sorcerer’s opponents within a 50' radius a -1 penalty to attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls, and saving throws against magical fear. The penalty lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). The sorcerer can only attempt to inspire dread in any given character once per day per class level. Opponents may save versus Spells to resist the effect.</p>
  <p>3rd level: The dominator’s unsettling presence inspires awe and dread in those around him. He gains the Intimidation proficiency.</p>
  <p>5th level: Though he still appears as a man, the Zaharan sorcerer has become a creature of darkness and horror. Once per day the sorcerer can cast inspire horror (as the 3rd level eldritch spell). The casting time ins one round (10 seconds).</p>
  <p>9th level: The dominator’s iron will and terrifying ruthlessness grant him utter domination over his minions. The sorcerer’s henchmen have base morale scores of +4 and no longer make morale rolls upon suffering calamities. (Unlike Command proficiency or Battlefield Prowess power, this power does not affect mercenaries).</p>
  <p>11th level: The dominator is a master of domination and deception. When the character casts enchantments or illusions, the spell effects are calculated as if he were two class levels higher than his actual level of experience. Targets of his enchantments suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw, as do those who attempt to disbelieve his illusions. This class power stacks with the <a href="#mastery-of-charms-and-illusions">Mastery of Charms and Illusions proficiency</a>.</p>
  <h4 id="sorcerer-of-necromancy">Sorcerer of Necromancy</h4>
  <p>Class Proficiencies: Apostasy, Righteous Turning, Sensing Evil, Theology <br>
  Weapons: Club, dagger, dart, staff<br>
  1st level: The necromancer has studied the secrets of the dark arts. He may control undead as a Chaotic cleric of one half his class level (round up). If the sorcerer casts spells that require a saving throw versus Death, his targets suffer a -2 penalty on the save. When the sorcerer casts necromancy spells, the spell effects are calculated as if he were two levels higher than his actual caster level.  This class power stacks with the <a href="#black-lore-of-zahar">Black Lore of Zahar proficiency</a>.</p>
  <p>3rd level: The necromancer has undertaken a deep study of anatomy, circulation, disease, and vitality. He gains one rank of Healing proficiency.</p>
  <p>5th level: The dead hold no secrets for the necromancer. The character can speak with the dead (as the spell) once per day. The casting time is 10 seconds (1 round).</p>
  <p>9th level: In black tomes and evil liturgies, the necromancer has gained lordship over the undead. Whenever the character succeeds in controlling undead (whether from a roll or automatically from a “T” result), the undead are controlled for 1 day per level  instead of the usual 1 turn per level. If the undead would have been controlled for 1 day per level (from a “D” result), the undead are instead controlled indefinitely.</p>
  <p>11th  level: The necromancer has finally unlocked the secrets of life and death. The sorcerer is able to perform necromancy at half the usual base time and cost.</p>
  <h4 id="sorcerer-of-summoning">Sorcerer of Summoning</h4>
  <p>Class Proficiencies: Command, Contemplation, Sensing Evil, Theology<br>
  Weapons: Dagger, dart, staff, whip<br>
  1st level: The summoner has brought forth a demon from the Outer Darkness and bound it in the form of an animal. The sorcerer gains the Familiar proficiency. Although the familiar will resemble a normal animal in most respects, there will be something alien or infernal about it, such as glowing eyes, sulfurous scent, etc.</p>
  <p>3rd level: The summoner’s familiar is a conduit to the esoteric. Select two 1st and one 2nd level black magic spells that the character has not yet added to his repertoire. When the familiar is within 30’ of the character, he can treat those spells as if they were in his  repertoire. (If the character later adds those spells to his actual repertoire, the familiar may become a conduit to new spells instead.)</p>
  <p>5th level: The summoner has made pacts with the demonic powers. The character can cast conjure hellion (as the spell) once per day. The casting time is 10 seconds (1 round).</p>
  <p>9th level: The summoner knows words of command and obedience that compel creatures to his inexorable will. Any creatures summoned by the sorcerer will obey him to the best of their ability rather than seek to pervert his intention. Any creatures he conjures will depart without harming him if his concentration is broken.</p>
  <p>11th level: Bargaining with the infernal powers has taught the summoner the power of sacrifice. He gains double normal divine power from blood sacrifices, and can store divine power from blood sacrifices indefinitely, even when not actively performing magical research. See the rules for Blood Sacrifice in ACKS on p. 125.</p>
  <h4 id="sorcerer-of-transmogrification">Sorcerer of Transmogrification</h4>
  <p>Class Proficiencies: Animal Husbandry, Animal Training, Beast Friendship, Riding<br>
  Weapons: Club, dagger, dart, whip</p>
  <p>1st level: The grotesque arts of transformation demand constant study. The character gains the Transmogrification proficiency.</p>
  <p>3rd level:  The transmogrifier’s self-experimentation has turned him into something both more and less than human. The character gains an abominable mutation, choosing from either beast eyes, claw-like nails, scaly skin, or tentacles. Beast eyes grant infravision 60’ but impose a -2 penalty to reaction rolls. Claw-like nails grant two attacks per round dealing 1d4-1 points of damage, but impose a -2 penalty to reaction rolls and a -2 penalty on proficiency throws requiring delicate work. Scaly skin grants a +2 AC, but reduces maximum movement rate by 25% and imposes a -4 penalty on reaction rolls. Tentacles allow the character to hold torches or other objects while keeping his hands free and grant two attacks per round dealing 1d3-1 points of damage, but impose a -2 penalty to reaction rolls. (Judges who own AX1, The Sinister Stone of Sakkara, can allow the transmogrifier to select other Abominable Mutations from that book if desired.)</p>
  <p>5th level: The transmogrifier has learned to transcend his own form. Once per day, the character can skinchange (as the 3rd level spell). The casting time is one round (10 seconds).</p>
  <p>9th level: Experiments combining living creatures with the transmogrifier’s own flesh and blood have created a hideous servant intimately bonded to his will. A sorcerer of monstrosity’s hideous servant is mechanically similar to a shaman’s totem animal (see Player’s Companion, p. 38). However, the sorcerer selects two of his hideous servant’s characteristics (AC, Movement, attack routine, and special abilities) from one animal and two characteristics from another, while the servant’s base Hit Dice are set to the average of the two animals selected. (Remember that actual HD will be adjusted by the character’s level.) He does not gain a totem benefit.</p>
  <p>11th level:  The transmogrifier can shape flesh and bone like clay. The sorcerer is able to create magical crossbreeds at half the usual base time and cost.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>EXAMPLE: Djarghul, a Zaharan sorcerer of monstrosity, has just reached 9th level, so he gains a hideous servant. Reviewing the Totem Animals table in the Player’s Companion, he decides to select the movement and attack routine of an eagle and the AC and special abilities of a cobra, with HD averaged between those of a cobra (2 HD) and eagle (1 HD). His hideous servant therefore has Move 480’ fly, AC 3, HD 1+2, #AT 2, Dmg 1d2/1d2, special abilities poison on successful attack, always has initiative. However an animal companion always has a number of Hit Dice equal to ½ the character’s own (9/2, or 4+2); and when an animal companion has greater Hit Dice than usual for its type, it will appear as a bigger, stronger version of and do +1 damage on each damage die. Therefore the final characteristics of his hideous servant are Move 480’ fly, AC 3, HD 4+2, #AT 2, Dmg 1d2+1/1d2+1, special abilities poison and initiative.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When a sorcerer reaches 5th level (Malefactor), he may begin to research spells, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. Sorcerers may collect and use divine power as clerics in order to fuel their magical research.</p>
  <p>When a sorcerer reaches 9th level (Sorcerer), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. A sorcerer may establish a sorcerer’s sanctum, usually in a remote and desolate location, when he reaches 9th level. He will then attract 1d6 apprentices of 1st-3rd level plus 2d6 normal men seeking to become sorcerers. Their intelligence scores will be above average, but many will become fearful of the sacrifices involved and quit after 1d6 months. While in the sorcerer’s service, apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. If the sorcerer builds a dungeon beneath or near his sanctum, monsters will start to arrive to dwell within, followed shortly by adventurers seeking to fight them.</p>
  <p>At 11th level, a sorcerer may learn and cast ritual arcane spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical cross-breeds. If chaotic, the sorcerer may create necromantic servants and become undead.</p>
  <p>All Zaharan sorcerers possess certain inhuman benefits and drawbacks from their demoniac bloodline. First, Zaharan sorcerers are inexorable in the face of horrors that terrify normal men. They are immune to all natural and magical fear effects.</p>
  <p>Second, sorcerers benefit from the ancient pacts of service and obedience by which the lords of Zahar ensorcelled the dark powers of the world. Some creatures still remember these pacts and will aid Zaharans when commanded. All Zaharan sorcerers gain a +2 bonus to reaction rolls when encountering intelligent chaotic monsters. Intelligent chaotic monsters suffer a -2 penalty to saving throws against any charm spells cast by a Zaharan sorcerer.</p>
  <p>Third, due to their background and training, all Zaharan sorcerers speak four dark tongues. In the Auran Empire campaign setting, these languages are Ancient Zaharan, Goblin, Orc, and Kemeshi. The Judge should substitute appropriate languages of his own devising for other campaigns.</p>
  <p>Finally, Zaharan sorcerers grow in power after the flesh. If transformed into intelligent undead, they retain their racial powers and any class abilities. Once transformed, a 1 HD undead sorcerer requires 4,000 XP to advance to 2 HD, and the amount of XP required to advance as an undead doubles with each HD thereafter (round values greater than 20,000 XP to the nearest 1,000). All of the sorcerer’s class abilities will continue to progress without regard to his class’s maximum level, to a maximum of 14th level. The sorcerer may continue to advance in Hit Dice without limit, even past his class’s maximum level.</p>
  <p>However, because of their dark souls, the grim embrace of death holds special perils for Zaharans. Whenever a deceased Zaharan rolls on the Tampering with Mortality table, he suffers a penalty on the 1d20 roll of -1 per level of experience.</p>

  <h2 id="core-campaign-and-racial-class-modifications">Core, Campaign, and Racial Class Modifications</h2>
  <p>When using the core, campaign, and racial classes found in ACKS and PC, the following rules and recommendations will help preserve a heroic fantasy flavor. Note that these modifications are completely optional; there are no mechanical reasons not to allow arcane, divine, and eldritch classes all play together, merely a stylistic ones.</p>
  <h3 id="fighting-and-thieving-classes">Fighting and Thieving Classes</h3>
  <p>In most heroic fantasy campaigns, the anti-paladin, assassin, barbarian, bard, explorer, fighter, mystic, paladin, and thief can be used without modification. See the <a href="#new-and-modified-equipment">New and Modified Equipment</a> section and the <a href="Chapter04.md#chapter-4-heroic-adventures">Heroic Adventures</a> section for important rules that apply to these classes, however!</p>
  <p>In Tolkienesque campaigns, the dwarven delver, dwarven fury, dwarven vaultguard, and elven ranger can also be used without modification, but the Thrassian gladiator should not be used. The dwarven machinist may be used at the Judge’s discretion. In Howardian campaigns, the dwarven and elven demi-human classes should not be used, but the Thrassian gladiator might be used at the Judge’s discretion.</p>
  <h3 id="arcane-spellcasting-classes">Arcane Spellcasting Classes</h3>
  <p>Arcane magic, as it appears in ACKS and most other D20 fantasy games, has a spell list closer to that of Marvel’s Dr. Strange than to that of Merlin, Gandalf, or Thoth-Amon. While the arcane and eldritch magic systems are compatible with and balanced against each other, flashy, high-powered arcane magic dramatically alters the feel of a campaign. Judges who wish to have an authentically heroic fantasy setting should replace all arcane magic with eldritch magic instead. Since eldritch magic has several drawbacks compared to arcane magic – its spells are less powerful and its spellcasters can suffer corruption – the existing arcane spellcasting classes need to either be replaced by new eldritch spellcasting classes in this book, or upgraded with additional powers. Follow these guidelines:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Replace the mage class with the loremaster class introduced in this book.</li>
  <li>Replace the venturer class with the revised (non-magical) venturer class introduced in this book.</li>
  <li>Replace the warlock class with the new occultist class introduced in this book.</li>
  <li>Replace the Nobiran wonderworker class with the Nobiran wizard introduced in this book.</li>
  <li>Grant elven courtiers, elven enchantresses, elven nightblades, elven spellswords, and gnomish tricksters spellsinging (as per the elven spellsinger class introduced in this book) as a class power.</li>
  <li>Grant Zaharan ruinguards inspire dread (as per the Zaharan sorcerer class power of the same name) and savage resilience (as per the barbarian class power of the same name) as class powers.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When converting elven courtiers, elven nightblades, elven enchantresses, elven spellswords, gnomish tricksters, and Zaharan ruinguards from arcane to eldritch spellcasting, the class’s level progression, Hit Dice, and attack throw progression are unchanged. If the class uses the mage saving throw progression and proficiency progression, substitute the cleric progression instead. Replace the mage spell progression (or fraction thereof) with the Nobiran wizard spell progression (or fraction thereof). Instead of selecting its spell repertoire from the arcane spell list, the class selects from the <a href="Chapter05.md#eldritch-spell-lists">eldritch spells list</a>. The class becomes subject to the rules for the <a href="Chapter05.md#the-shades-of-magic">shades of magic</a> The class gains the ability to accumulate divine power as a cleric and to use clerical magic items.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Judges may wonder why the human arcane spellcasting classes are replaced with ceremonialists (loremasters and occultists) while the various demi-human spellcasting classes remain spellcasters. The reason is authenticity to the heroic tradition: the notion that mortal men of ordinary birth can become capable of instantaneously casting flashy spells simply from study is largely foreign to both the Tolkienesque and Howardian traditions of heroic fantasy, and arises mostly in post-heroic (contemporary) fantasy. In the heroic tradition, human magicians must work magic through esoteric ceremonies requiring magical implements and strange reagents; any magicians who can work magic swiftly and easily are never truly human. Thus in Heroic Fantasy Handbook, the recommended classes only allow humans to perform magical ceremonies, not to cast spells. Human magic-users are therefore always ceremonialists, such as the loremaster, occultist, and runemaker; while only demi-humans can be true spellcasters, such as the elven spellsinger, Nobiran wizard, and Zaharan sorcerer. Of course there are some heroic fantasy settings with human spellcasters, and Judges who want them can add them by following the suggestions listed in the Nobiran wizard class, or by creating custom classes using the Custom Class creation rules in the ACKS Player’s Companion along with the modifications provided in the <a href="Chapter08.md#chapter-8-heroic-secrets">Secrets chapter</a> of this supplement.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3 id="divine-spellcasting-classes">Divine Spellcasting Classes</h3>
  <p>Divine magic, as it appears in ACKS and most other D20 fantasy games, has a spell list primarily derived from Old and New Testament miracles. While some of these effects do occur in heroic fantasy, they are generally rare and usually of unclear provenance. Spells that explicitly affirm the existence of an afterlife and gods, such as commune and raise dead, are exceptionally rare. For this reason, divine magic should be replaced by eldritch magic instead. See the rules for <a href="Chapter05.md#eldritch-magic">eldritch magic</a> in the Magic chapter.</p>
  <p>The cleric, as it appears in most retro-clones (including ACKS), combines miraculous spells, vampire-fighting powers from Dave Arneson’s First Fantasy campaign, and weapon choices based on loopholes of medieval ecclesiastical law. It’s an odd mix that does not fit into heroic campaigns based on either fictional or mythic sources.</p>
  <p>We recommend using ecclesiastics, a new class in this book, to represent noncombatant medieval clergy with miraculous powers; and using paladins, from the Player’s Companion, to represent fighting monks such as the Knights Templar. For pagan priests and priestesses, use bladedancers, priestesses, shamans, or witches, or the loremaster, runemaker, or occultist classes in this book.</p>
  <p>The other divine casters found in ACKS are a better fit for heroic fantasy, although for reasons noted above they should perform ceremonies rather than cast spells. Thus bladedancers, dwarven craftpriests, priestesses, shamans, and witches should all become eldritch ceremonialists, exchanging the ability to cast divine spells as a cleric for the ability to perform eldritch ceremonies. As eldritch ceremonialists, these classes should pick their ceremonies from the eldritch spell list instead of the divine spell list. They become susceptible to corruption but do not lose their powers if they breach their faith’s tenets. Here are some additional guidelines:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Ceremonial bladedancers follower the liturgical or runic tradition (Judge’s choice) and use the runemaker ceremony progression. Ceremonial bladedancers lose the turn undead class power. Instead they begin play with their choice of any two of the following class powers: alluring beauty (as a warmistress), charismatic ferocity (as a warmistress), classical weapons training (as an elven courtier), personal talisman (as the proficiency), study of war (as a Nobiran champion), or weapon finesse (as a warmistress).</li>
  <li>Ceremonial dwarven craftpriests follow the runic tradition and use the runemaker ceremony progression. To reflect the archetype of the magical crafter, ceremonial craftpriests begin play as master craftsmen (with three ranks in their chosen craft instead of two) with a personal talisman (as the proficiency) from their craft. However, they lose the turn undead class power.</li>
  <li>Ceremonial priestesses can follow the antiquarian, liturgical, or theurgical tradition (Judge’s choice) and use the occultist ceremony progression. If desired, noncombatant male ceremonialists of a Lawful religion can be ceremonial priests of the runic, liturgical, or theurgical tradition. Alternatively, priestesses can be replaced with female ecclesiastics.</li>
  <li>Ceremonial shamans follow the shamanic or runic traditions (Judge’s choice) and use the runemaker ceremony progression. In addition, ceremonial shamans exchange the ability to commune with spirits for a  personal talisman (as the proficiency), and exchange the ability to perform spirit rituals with the ability to divine the wisdom of the ancestral spirits once per day (as the revised Prophecy proficiency).</li>
  <li>Ceremonial witches follow the ceremonial magic tradition which equates to their <a href="Chapter05.md#ceremonial-traditions">tradition of witchcraft</a>. Ceremonial witches use the occultist ceremony progression. Ceremonial witches exchange their tradition’s bonus spells for a personal talisman (as the proficiency).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>See the <a href="Chapter05.md#eldritch-magic">eldritch magic</a> and <a href="Chapter05.md#ceremonial-magic">ceremonial magic</a> rules in the Magic chapter for more details.</p>
  <h2 id="new-and-modified-proficiencies">New and Modified Proficiencies</h2>
  <p>Some proficiencies that appear in the ACKS Core Rules and ACKS Player’s Companion have been updated, either to be compatible with new mechanics such as Base Healing Rate, or to better reflect the nature of a heroic campaign. In addition, new proficiencies have been introduced that relate to new game features such as ceremonial magic, spellsinging, and hero points.</p>

  <p><strong>Alchemy (G):</strong> The character can identify common alchemical substances, potions, and poisons with a proficiency throw of 11+. If the character takes this proficiency twice, he can work as an apothecary or alchemical assistant. If the character takes this proficiency three times, he is an alchemist himself, and may brew potions as if he were a 5th level mage, but at twice the base time and cost. A character already capable of brewing potions because of his class level may add his Alchemy ranks to his Magic Research throws when brewing potions, and if he has selected the proficiency three times, he can brew potions at half the usual base time and cost.</p>
  <p><strong>Animal Husbandry / Healing (G):</strong> The character is especially skilled at treating wounds and diagnosing illnesses among animals (Animal Husbandry) or among humans and demi-humans (Healing). If the character makes a proficiency throw of 11+, he can identify whether a disease is magical or mundane, and if mundane, diagnose it. A patient under treatment of a character with Animal Husbandry or Healing recovers twice his base healing rate in hp each day of rest.</p>
  <p>If the character selects Animal Husbandry or Healing twice, his proficiency throw to identify and diagnose diseases is reduced to 7+. He can attempt to neutralize poison, cure disease, or cure light wounds with a proficiency throw of 18+, once per day per patient.</p>
  <p>If the character selects Animal Husbandry or Healing three times, his proficiency throw to identify and diagnose diseases is reduced to 3+. He can attempt to neutralize poison, cure disease, or cure serious wounds with a proficiency throw of 14+, once per day per patient.</p>
  <p>Any character with Animal Husbandry Healing proficiency can use healing herbs (e.g. blackwort, comfrey, goldenrod, and woundwort) to heal additional damage or gain a bonus on his proficiency throws.  In any one day, a character can supervise three different patients, plus an additional one each time Animal Husbandry or Healing is selected.</p>
  <p>A character with two or more ranks of Animal Husbandry may treat humans and demi-humans as if he had the Healing proficiency at one rank less than his Animal Husbandry proficiency. A character with two or more ranks of Healing may treat animals as if he had the Animal Husbandry proficiency at one rank less than his Healing proficiency.</p>

  <p><strong>Apostasy:</strong> If a ceremonialist, the character may select 4 eldritch ceremonies and add them to his repertoire of ceremonies known. If an eldritch spellcaster, the character may select 3 eldritch spells and add them to his repertoire of spells known. If the ceremonies or spells selected with this proficiency are above the level that the character is permitted to know, he will add them to his repertoire when he reaches the appropriate level.</p>
  <p><strong>Arcane Dabbling:</strong> The character may attempt to use magic items created with arcane or eldritch magic. At level 1, the character must make a proficiency throw of 18+ or the attempt backfires. The proficiency throw required reduces by 2 per level, to a minimum of 3+. Note that bards automatically begin play with this ability as part of their class.</p>
  <p><strong>Art/Craft (G):</strong> The character has studied a fine art (e.g., painting, sculpture, mosaic) or guild craft (e.g. armorer, bowyer, jeweler, leatherworker, smith, shipwright, or weaponsmith). The character is considered an apprentice in his trade. He can manufacture 10gp per month of goods, and can identify masterwork items, rare materials, and famous artisans with a proficiency throw of 11+.  The character must choose the art or craft at the time he chooses the proficiency. He can spend more proficiency selections to have several types of art or craft proficiencies.</p>
  <p>If a character selects the same art or craft twice, he is considered a journeyman in his trade. He can manufacture 20gp per month of goods, and supervise up to 3 apprentices, increasing their productivity by 50%. If he selects the same craft three times, he is considered a master craftsman. He can manufacture 40gp per month, and supervise up to 2 journeymen and 4 apprentices, increasing their productivity by 50%. He could work as a specialist in this art or craft.</p>
  <p>If a character selects the same art or craft four times, he is considered a grand master artist or craftsman. He can manufacture 80gp per month, and supervise up to 2 masters, 4 journeymen, and 8 apprentices, increasing their productivity by 50% (for a total construction rate of 440gp per month). Working alone or with his subordinates, a grand master can create masterwork items appropriate to his art or craft:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>A masterwork weapon costing 80gp extra may provide +1 to hit or +1 to damage. A masterwork weapon costing 650gp extra provides both +1 to hit and damage. In neither case does the weapon provide the ability to hit magical monsters, unless forged of a material otherwise capable of doing so (e.g. silver). Additional ornaments or engraving can add to the weapon’s value without necessarily increasing the weapon’s characteristics.</li>
  <li>A masterwork set of armor costing 80gp extra weighs one less stone (armor or shields weighing one stone counts as one item instead) while providing normal AC. A masterwork set of armor costing 650gp extra provides +1 AC while weighing the same as normal. Additional ornaments or engraving can add to the value without necessarily improving the armor’s characteristics.</li>
  <li>A masterwork structure costing 2 times normal gains +1 to AC or +10% to structural hit points. A masterwork structure costing 4 times normal gains both +1 to AC and +10% to structural hit points.</li>
  <li>A masterwork ship costing 2 times normal gains +1 to AC, +10% to structural hit points, or +10% to movement rate. A masterwork ship costing 4 times normal gains any two such benefits. A masterwork ship costing 8 times normal gains all three such benefits.</li>
  <li>A miscellaneous piece of masterwork art or craftsmanship may be of such beauty and quality as to be worth anywhere from 2 to 100 times normal value.</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
  <p>EXAMPLE: Ragnar, a 6th level dwarven craftpriest, has four ranks in Craft (weapon-smithing), giving him a construction rate of 80gp per month. He decides to craft a masterwork war hammer with +1 to hit and damage. The base cost of a war hammer is 5gp, so Ragnar’s masterwork war hammer will cost (650gp + 5gp) 655gp. It will take Ragnar (655gp / 80gp) 8.2 months to craft his masterpiece.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The process of making a weapon, shield or set of armor into a +1 or greater item automatically transforms it into a masterwork, so the bonuses do not stack. However, enchanting masterworks is easier than enchanting mundane items. Apply the value of the masterwork item towards the cost of precious materials used to enchant the item.</p>
  <p>A grand master artist or craftsman who is able to create magic items due to his class level can imbue magical effects into items he personally crafts at half the usual base time and cost. If he has a sample or formula for the item as well, he can imbue magical effects at one-quarter the usual base time and cost. When doing so, he may add his ranks in his Art/Craft proficiency to the magical research throw to create the item.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>EXAMPLE: Ragnar, now 9th level, has gained the ability to create permanent magical items. He decides to enchant his masterwork war hammer to +2. He has a sample war hammer +2.  The base cost to create a war hammer +2 is 30,000 gp. The base time is (2 month x 5gp / 10gp) 1 month. Because Ragnar is a grand master craftsman, the base cost is halved to 15,000gp and the base time to 2 weeks. Because Ragnar has a sample to work from, the base cost is halved again to 7,500 gp and the base time to 1 week.  He gains a +4 bonus on the magic research throw to enchant the war hammer, and the value of the war hammer, 600gp, counts towards the cost of precious materials used to enchant the item.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When items made by grand masters or above are discovered, their mark or style will be apparent to characters who make the appropriate Art, Craft, Knowledge, or Loremastery roll.</p>

  <p><strong><a name="beast-friendship"></a>Beast Friendship:</strong> The character is well-schooled in the natural world. He can identify plants and fauna with a proficiency throw of 11+, and understands the subtle body language and moods of birds and beasts (though they may not understand the character). He gains +2 to all reaction rolls when encountering normal animals, and can take animals as henchmen. If the character has this proficiency and the friends of birds and beasts class power, he can identify plants and fauna with a throw of 7+ and can take one more henchman than his Charisma would otherwise permit, as long as at least one is an animal.</p>
  <p><strong><a name="black-lore-of-zahar"></a>Black Lore of Zahar:</strong> The character has studied the terrible necromancies of ancient Zahar. He can control undead as a Chaotic cleric of one half his class level (rounded up). If the character casts spells that require a saving throw versus Death, his targets suffer a -2 penalty on the save. When the character casts necromantic spells (such as animate dead), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two class levels higher than his actual level of experience. He may also conduct necromantic research (see Necromancy in Chapter 7) as if he were two class levels higher than actual. If the character has this proficiency and the secrets of the dark arts class power, the character can control undead as a cleric of two-thirds his class level (rounded up), and his necromantic spells and research are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher than his actual caster level.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses is a 9th level occultist with both secrets of the dark arts class power and Black Lore of Zahar proficiency. Therefore he controls undead as if he were a Chaotic cleric of (9 x 2/3) 6th level. He casts necromantic spells and performs necromantic research as if he were 12th level.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Combat Trickery:</strong> The character is a cunning and tricky fighter. Pick a special maneuver from any one of the following: Disarm, Force Back, Incapacitate, Knock Down, Overrun, Sunder, or Wrestle. When the character attempts this special maneuver in combat, the normal penalty for attempting the maneuver is reduced by 2 (e.g. from -4 to -2), and his opponent suffers a -2 penalty to his saving throw to resist the special maneuver. In addition, anytime the character lands a <a href="Chapter04.md#critical-hits">critical hit</a>, he may apply his special maneuver as an effect in lieu of the outcome he rolled if desired. A character may take Combat Trickery multiple times, selecting an additional special maneuver to learn each time.</p>
  <p><strong>Illusion Resistance:</strong> This proficiency is replaced by Second Sight.</p>
  <p><strong>Laying on Hands:</strong> The character can heal himself or another by laying on hands once per day. The character healed recovers hp as if he had rested for one day per two levels of the healer (rounded up).  A character may take this proficiency multiple times. Each time it is taken, the character may lay on hands an additional time per day.</p>
  <p><strong>Magical Music:</strong> If the character is not already a spellsinger, then he gains a limited ability to spellsing. The character gets two spell points and has one 1st level spell in his repertoire, which he casts as a 1st level spellsinger. A character already capable of spellsinging who selects this proficiency gains an additional two spell points and can add one additional spell (of any level he can cast) to his repertoire. The proficiency may be selected multiple times.</p>
  <p><strong>Prophecy:</strong> The character is subject to premonitions and dreams of the past and future. The Judge will make these visions both cryptic and useful. Once per day, the character may cast divination (as the spell). The casting time is 10 minutes (1 turn).</p>
  <p><strong>Soothsaying:</strong> The character has been trained to read the omens in everyday things – the throw of dice, the flight of birds, or the leaves of tea. Once every 8 hours, he can cast augury (as the spell). The casting time is 10 seconds (1 round).</p>
  <p><strong>Weapon Focus:</strong> The character is an expert at delivering critical hits with a type of favored weapon. Any time the result of a successful attack throw with a favored weapon exceeds the target value by 7 or more (instead of the usual 10 or more), the attacker has dealt a critical hit to its target. A character may take this proficiency multiple times, selecting an additional Weapon Focus each time. The available Weapon Focuses are: axes; maces, flails and hammers; swords and daggers; bows and crossbows; slings and thrown weapons; spears and polearms. Weapon Focus does not allow a character to use weapons not available to his class.</p>
  <h3 id="new-proficiencies">New Proficiencies</h3>
  <p><strong><a name="bright-lore-of-aura"></a>Bright Lore of Aura:</strong> The character has studied the white magic of the Empyreans. The character can turn undead as a cleric of one half his class level (rounded up). If the character casts spells that require a saving throw versus Paralysis, his targets suffer a -2 penalty on the save. When the character casts protection spells, the spell effects are calculated as if he were two caster levels higher than his actual caster level. If the character has this proficiency and the bright lore class power, the character can turn undead as a cleric of two-thirds his class level (rounded up), and his protection spells are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher than his actual caster level.</p>
  <p><strong>Ceremonial Magic:</strong> The character has studied the ceremonies of a particular tradition of ceremonial magic (antiquarian, chthonic, sylvan, shamanic, or theurgical). The character must choose the tradition at the time he chooses the proficiency. This proficiency can be selected multiple times. The effect of this proficiency depends upon the class powers of the character selecting it.</p>
  <p>If the character is neither a spellcaster nor a ceremonialist, then he becomes a 1st level ceremonialist with a repertoire of one 1st level ceremony. He can perform ceremonies in the tradition and create and use trinkets and talismans in the tradition as a 1st level ceremonialist, and can identify trinkets or talismans created by a ceremonialist of the tradition with a proficiency throw of 11+ and of other traditions with an 18+.</p>
  <p>If the character is a spellcaster, but is not already a ceremonialist, he becomes a ceremonialist of his caster level upon taking this proficiency. He can perform any ceremonies in the tradition and create and use trinkets and talismans in the tradition as a ceremonialist of his caster level, and can identify trinkets or talismans created by a ceremonialist of the tradition with a proficiency throw of 11+ and of other traditions with an 18+.</p>
  <p>If the character is already a ceremonialist, he can either reduce the proficiency throw required to identify trinkets and talismans of a tradition he already knows by 4; learn another tradition; or add one ceremony (of any level he can cast) to his repertoire.</p>
  <p>See the rules for <a href="Chapter05.md#ceremonial-magic">Ceremonial Magic</a> in the Magic section for more details.</p>
  <p><strong>Destined:</strong> The character gains two Fate Points. This proficiency does not appear on any class lists. The Judge should decide if this proficiency exists in his setting. If so, any character may select it as one of his class proficiencies.</p>
  <p><strong>Farseeing:</strong> The character can see the fates of mortals. He may determine how many Fate Points a character has after 10 minutes (1 turn) of casual interaction or observation. Once per week, the character may cast fate (as the spell) with a casting time of 10 minutes (1 turn).</p>
  <p><strong><a name="mastery-of-charms-and-illusions"></a>Mastery of Charms and Illusions:</strong> When the character casts enchantment spells (such as charm person) or illusion spells (such as phantasmal force), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two class levels higher than his actual level of experience. Targets of his enchantment spells suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw, as do those who attempt to disbelieve his illusions. If the character has this proficiency and the mastery of domination and deception class power, the character can cast enchantments and illusions as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher than his actual caster level, and targets suffer a -3 penalty to their saving throws.</p>
  <p><strong><a name="personal-talisman"></a>Personal Talisman:</strong> A ceremonialist with the Personal Talisman proficiency has created a special magic item, his personal talisman, which he uses to aid him in performing ceremonies. When the proficiency is first taken, the character immediately gains a talisman of his own tradition which provides a +1 bonus to ceremony throws for ceremonies of one particular type. The character may choose from death &amp; necromancy; detection; elemental air; elemental earth; elemental fire; elemental water; enchantment &amp; illusion; healing; movement; protection; summoning; and transmogrification. Each time the proficiency is selected thereafter, the personal talisman can increase its bonus by +1 for one type of ceremony. A character may never have more than one personal talisman at a time, and a personal talisman may never be used by anyone other than the character.</p>
  <p>If the character’s personal talisman is ever lost or destroyed, the character may make a new one. Making a new personal talisman costs 5,000gp less than normal per rank in the proficiency, with the equivalent reductions in time, special components, and workshop requirements. Any magic research throws to make the personal talisman are always successful.</p>
  <p><strong>Second Sight:</strong> The character has a connection to the hidden world, and can see innately or magically invisible creatures within 60’. Invisible creatures are aware that the character can see them, and may often take a particular interest in him as a result. Second sight does not provide the ability to see characters hiding in shadows, secret doors, traps, or other creatures or objects hidden through cover and concealment, but does provide a +4 bonus to saving throws to disbelieve illusions. This proficiency replaces Illusion Resistance in ACKS.</p>

  <p><strong>Arena Armor, Heavy:</strong> A set of stylized heavy armor designed to expose the wearer’s attractive form and musculature while fighting. Characters with clean-limbed bodies (STR, DEX, CON, and CHA all 11+) gain a +1 bonus to Seduction rolls when wearing arena armor.    Depending on the wearer’s taste and style, heavy arena armor can include form-fitting leather, scale, or lamellar; sections of mail; and/or solitary pieces of plate on limbs and vital areas. It provides 4 points of protection and weighs 4 stone, and counts as chain armor for game purposes. Historical examples of heavy arena armor include that of the hoplomachus, provocator, and thraex types. Fantasy examples might include Morgana’s metal corset in Excalibur, Alia’s hauberk in Azure Bonds, and most of the armor seen in Xena: Warrior Princess. Heavy arena armor can also be used to simulate partial sets of heavier armor. Cost: 50gp</p>
  <p><strong>Arena Armor, Light:</strong> A set of stylized light armor designed to expose the wearer’s attractive form and musculature while fighting. Characters with clean-limbed bodies (STR, DEX, CON, and CHA all 11+) gain a +1 bonus to reaction rolls using Seduction when wearing arena armor. Depending on the wearer’s taste and style, light arena armor can include form-fitting cloth or leather; thin straps of mail; and/or solitary pieces of plate on the limbs. It provides 2 points of protection and weighs 2 stone, and counts as leather armor for game purposes. Historical examples of light arena armor include that of the dimachaerus, myrmillo, retiarius, and secutor types. Fantasy examples might include Red Sonja’s chainmail bikini, He-Man’s battle harness, and most of the armor drawn by Frank Frazetta or Luis Royo. Light arena armor can also be used to simulate very partial sets of armor. Cost: 30gp</p>
  <p><strong>Cestus:</strong> A pair of armored battle gloves, made with leather strips and fitted with blades, spikes, and/or iron plates.  Characters equipped with cestus may deal 1d3 points of lethal damage with a punch. Cost: 3gp</p>
  <p><strong>Helmet, Heavy:</strong> This is a metal close-faced or visored helmet that completely covers the face, head, and neck. A heavy helmet must be purchased separately from a suit of armor. Wearing a heavy helm imposes a -1 penalty to surprise rolls and -4 penalty to proficiency throws to hear noise, but offers a +2 bonus on d20 rolls made on the Mortal Wounds table. Historical examples of heavy helmets include the classical Corinthian helmet, Roman gladiatorial helmets, and the medieval armet, barbute, close helm, great helm, and hounskull. Cost: 20gp</p>
  <p><strong>Helmet, Light:</strong> This is any leather or metal open-faced helmet designed to protect the head and neck while maintaining unrestricted sight and breathing. A light helmet is included in the cost of any suit of armor. If a suit of armor is worn without a helmet, decrease the character’s armor class by 1 point. A light helmet can purchased separately from a suit of armor at a cost of 5gp, but provides no in-game benefit. Historical examples include the Illyrian, Phyrgian, Boeotian, Attic, and Galean helmets of Antiquity, the medieval bascinet, nasal helm, and spangenhelm, and the Renaissance burgonet and sallet.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p><strong>Clang of Helmets Memorial Rule (optional):</strong>  Armor is assumed to exclude helmets. A character wearing a light helmet gains a +1 bonus to his AC. A characters wearing a heavy helmet gains a +2 to his AC. This rule can help offset a lack of magical enhancement to armor class in low-magic campaigns.</p>

  <p><strong>Aloe:</strong> Aloe, also known as burn plant, is a healing herb used to treat burns. A character with Healing proficiency can use a liniment of aloe to treat a patient with acid, cold, electrical, or fire damage. The patient is healed one-half his base healing rate, or up to the amount of acid, cold, electrical or fire damage suffered, whichever is less. A patient cannot be treated with a liniment of aloe more than once per day. Applying the liniment takes 1 turn (10 minutes). Cost: 10gp</p>
  <p><strong>Bitterwood:</strong> Bitterwood, also known as quassia, is an healing herb used to induce vomiting. A character with Healing proficiency can treat a patient who has ingested poison within 1 turn (10 minutes) with an emetic of bitterwood.  Upon consuming the emetic, the patient must make a saving throw v. Poison. If the save succeeds, the patient spends the next 1d3 turns purging himself of the poison, neutralizing it. If the save fails, the character still loses 1d3 turns purging himself, but it does not neutralize the poison. Administering the emetic takes 1 round (10 seconds). Cost: 10gp</p>
  <p><strong>Black Lotus:</strong> Block lotus is an eldritch herb prized by sorcerers and occultists. When powdered and burned in a brazier, black lotus releases a wispy smoke in a 2.5’ radius for 1 turn (10 minutes). Those who inhale the smoke may fall into a death-like sleep characterized by monstrous dreams. If a character begins his initiative in the smoke, or enters the smoke, he may make a saving throw versus Poison. If the saving throw fails, or the character chooses not to save, he falls into a deep slumber for 1d3 hours. If the character is a spellcaster or ceremonialist, the number of hours is extended by one-half the highest level spell or ceremony he knows (rounded down). During this time, the character is completely helpless and cannot be awakened by any means short of dealing damage. If the character is allowed to slumber and awaken naturally, he will wake up empowered with  magic. An eldritch spellcaster will gain access to all of his expended spells, exactly as if he had benefited from a day’s rest and study. An eldritch ceremonialist will purify himself of all accumulated stigma. Other characters will temporarily gain a repertoire of one random 1st level black magic ceremony  for use in the next 24 hours (stigma threshold 1). The benefits of black lotus come at a price, however; the nightmares it brings cause the character to accumulate 1 corruption point per hour of drugged sleep. Cost: 200gp.</p>
  <p><strong>Blessed Thistle:</strong> Blessed thistle, also known as spotted thistle, is an healing herb that helps wounds heal more quickly. A character with the Healing proficiency can use a poultice of blessed thistle to treat a wounded patient at any time. If the patient rests, his base healing rate for the day is increased by one row on the BHR table for purposes of natural healing. If the patient does not rest, he recovers one-half the hit points he would have recovered if he had rested. Applying the poultice takes 1 round (10 seconds). Cost: 10gp</p>
  <p><strong>Horsetail:</strong> Horsetail, also known as snake grass, is an healing herb that slows bleeding and promotes clotting. A character with Healing proficiency can use a poultice of horsetail to treat the wounds of an unconscious and possibly mortally wounded patient (with 0 hit points or fewer). Used in this manner, it provides an additional +2 bonus to the patient’s 1d20 roll on the Mortal Wounds table. A character with two ranks of Healing proficiency can use a poultice of horsetail to delay death with a proficiency throw of 18+ (one attempt per patient). A character with three ranks of Healing proficiency can use a poultice of horsetail to delay death with a proficiency throw of 14+. Applying the poultice takes 1 round (10 seconds). Cost: 15gp</p>
  <p><strong>Lungwort:</strong> Lungwort is an healing herb used to treat diseased and damaged lungs. A character with Healing proficiency can brew a tincture of lungwort to relieve a patient of the wilderness movement penalty and rest requirements from permanent wounds (“lungs and heart damaged”). Brewing the tincture takes 1 turn (10 minutes) and the relief lasts for 4 hours. Cost: 5gp</p>
  <p><strong>Willow-Bark:</strong> Willow-bark is an healing herb that relieves aches, pain, and rheumatism. A character with Healing proficiency can brew a tincture of willow-bark to relieve a patient of the initiative penalty from permanent wounds (e.g. “stiff and scarred wounds” and “lasting wounds that ache in bad weather”), from inability to force march due to permanent wounds (“damage to hips and lower back” “damage to knee,” “lungs and heart damaged”), or from the attack throw and damage roll penalty from force marching. Brewing the tincture takes 1 turn (10 minutes) and the relief lasts for 4 hours. Cost: 5gp</p>

  <p><strong>Metamphora:</strong> Designed to store special components, metamphora are ceramic jars inscribed with alchemical sigils and stoppered with copper seals. Metamphora come in an array of different sizes and shapes, as more valuable special components require sturdier, stronger metamphora to prevent leakage. Metamphora cost 5gp and weigh 1 stone for every 60gp of value they store</p>
  <p><strong>Special Components, Miscellaneous:</strong>   When a living thing dies, a residue of its soul will linger in some its component parts, such as organs and cellular fluids. These parts are known as special components and can be tapped by casters and ceremonialists to power their magic items. While the best results are gained from rare components that are unique to the spells or ceremonies imbued into the item, an equal value of miscellaneous special components such as spider webs, plant roots, crushed bones, and so on can be used instead if desired. The caster or ceremonialist suffers a -1 penalty on his throw per level of the spell or ceremony when using miscellaneous special components in magical research.</p>
  <p><strong>Thieves’ Garb:</strong> A suit of clothing, including hooded cloak, tunic, leggings, gloves, and scarf, woven in a camouflaging color. Thieves’ garb is available in different colors for use in various environments – brown for hills/mountains, green for forest/jungle, grey for settlements, white for tundra, etc. When wearing thieves’ garb appropriate to the environment, a character gains a +2 bonus to any proficiency throws to hide in shadows, avoid being spotted, and evade in the wilderness. Characters wearing thieves’ garb can always hide in shadows or avoid being spotted with a throw of at least 18+. Thieves’ garb imposes a -2 penalty when its camouflage color is inappropriate to the environment (e.g. white garb in the jungle). The bonus and penalty do not apply to hijinks. Thieves’ garb can be worn over leather armor, but not heavier types. Cost: 25gp.</p>
  <p><strong>Thieves’ Tools Companion Kit:</strong> A companion set of tools to use in conjunction with the standard set of thieves’ tools, this set includes drills, pliers, scissors, rods, blocks, pads, tweezers, shims, and a magnifying glass.

  <p><strong>Thieves' Tools, Superior:</strong> Superior thieves’ tools grant a +2 bonus to proficiency throws to Open Locks, Find Traps, and Remove Traps. If the thief rolls a natural 1 while attempting to pick a lock, the tools may make a saving throw versus Death (at 1/2 thief’s level of experience) to resist breaking (see <a href="Chapter04.md#thievery">Thievery</a> in the Adventuring chapter). The bonus does not apply to hijinks. Cost: 200gp.</p>
  <p><strong>Thieves’ Tools, Masterwork:</strong> Masterwork thieves' tools grant a +4 to proficiency throws to Open Locks, Find Traps, and Remove Traps. If the thief rolls a natural 1 while attempting to pick a lock, the tools may make a saving throw versus Death (at the thief’s level) to resist breaking (see <a href="Chapter04.md#thievery">Thievery</a> in the Adventuring chapter). The bonus does not apply to hijinks. Cost: 1,600gp.</p>
